[[File:Alliance of Renewal Churches logo.jpg|150px|right]]
The '''Alliance of Renewal Churches''' (ARC) is a network of leaders and churches committed to creating and sustaining an atmosphere beneficial for kingdom relationships, transformation and mission so that souls may be saved, disciples made, and whole and healthy leaders developed.

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=charismatic}}
The Alliance of Renewal Churches embraces the evangelical, charismatic, and sacramental streams of the [[Christianity|Christian Faith]]. Members of the ARC celebrate, not merely tolerate, the empowering presence of the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]. The network is kingdom-driven while appreciating a shared [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] heritage. Growing in safe-place authentic relationships is a critical value in the ARC. Leaders in the ARC relate to one another as a band of brothers and sisters who are on mission together.

The group assumes a conservative, [[Lutheran theology|Lutheran theological base]], but is not issues-oriented.  Congregations and/or individual church leaders can join.  Congregations can retain membership in other groups while belonging to the ARC or they can belong exclusively to the ARC.

The ARC grew out of the charismatic revival in the mainline churches and its several dozen churches are focused mostly in the Midwest and the California/Arizona region. It has a strong relationship with the Master's Institute Seminary. The largest churches in the ARC are Hosanna! and North Heights in Minnesota and Penasquitos Lutheran in San Diego. 

The movement has annual gatherings; rotating between the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].

Worship in ARC churches tends to be very expressive and uninhibited and the messages tend to be followed by "ministry time" where those attending the service can come forward for personal prayer.

'''The American Association of Lutheran Churches''' (TAALC, also known as The AALC) is an American [[Lutheran]] church body. It was formed on November 7, 1987 as a continuation of the [[American Lutheran Church]] (ALC) denomination, the majority of which merged with two other Lutheran church bodies, the [[Lutheran Church in America]] (LCA) and the [[Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches]] (AELC), to form the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]. The AALC offices were located in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]]. The national office moved to [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] in 2007. It has 67 congregations, with about 16,000 members, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/denoms/D_1414.asp|title=American Association of Lutheran Churches|publisher=Association of Religion Data Archives|accessdate=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current Presiding Pastor is the Rev. Dr. Curtis E. Leins.

==Historical Background==
{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=alc}}
The AALC began with 12 congregations and has, as of 2008, grown to 70 congregations spread across 23 states. The AALC sees itself as a confessional Lutheran Church body in the United States. At its beginning, TAALC defined itself by what it saw as maintaining a commitment to the authority of Holy Scripture and the teaching of the Lutheran confessions by way of retaining the Confession of Faith of the American Lutheran Church. 

The AALC operates its own seminary, The [[American Lutheran Theological Seminary]] (ALTS), originally located in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. In the fall of 2005, ALTS relocated to [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] and is hosted by [[Concordia Theological Seminary]] of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS).

The AALC holds to the inerrancy of scripture. It does not ordain women as pastors.  However, women may serve as deaconesses. The AALC has two paths to ordination. Besides in congregations, its rostered pastors also serve as chaplains in the U.S. Armed Services, hospitals, correctional facilities, law enforcement, hospice, and a host of other specialized ministries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Two AALC pastors are well known within confessional Lutheranism: Chris Rosebrough of Pirate Christian Radio and Jordan Cooper, who is an author, conference speaker, and host of the Just and Sinner podcasts. The AALC is also the denominational home of Trinity Lutheran Church of San Pedro, California, which was a key church in the Lutheran Renewal movement in the 60's under the leadership of the Rev. Larry Christensen.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Fellowship with the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod==
Since 1989 representatives of The AALC and the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) have met in a series of official and unofficial talks. After six official meetings, at which various doctrinal papers were submitted, representatives of both The AALC and the LCMS have recommended to their respective church bodies that they enter into [[altar and pulpit fellowship]] with one another. The proposal was brought before theology/doctrine commissions of each church body before being presented at their respective national conventions.  During the June 20–23, 2007 TAALC National Convention, the AALC declared fellowship with the LCMS; and voted to join the [[International Lutheran Council]] (ILC).  On July 16, 2007, the LCMS declared fellowship with the AALC during the LCMS 63rd Regular Convention. The bonds between the two sister churches continue to grow and flourish.

==Basic beliefs of the AALC==
(from their Web site)

*Affirms the full authority of the Bible as the inerrant and infallible Word of God
*The Lutheran Confessions as a true interpretation of Scripture
*A purpose focused on the Great Commission with priority for Evangelism and World Missions
*The authority of the local congregation as the basic unit of the church

==Presiding pastors==
*Rev. Dr. Duane L. Lindberg 1987–1999
*Rev. Thomas V. Aadland 1999–2007
*Rev. Franklin E. Hays 2007–2014
*Rev. Dr. Curtis E. Leins 2014-

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=awakening}}
The '''Apostolic Lutheran Church of America''' (ALCA) is a [[Laestadianism|Laestadian]] [[Lutheran]] [[Christian denominations|church]] denomination established by [[Finnish-Americans|Finnish American]] and Norwegian immigrants in the 1800s. They came mainly from northern [[Finland]] and northern [[Norway]] where they had been members of the state churches. Most or all members had ties from their home countries to the [[Laestadianism|Laestadian]] revival movement named after [[Church of Sweden|Swedish state church]] administrator and pastor [[Lars Levi Laestadius]] of [[Pajala]], [[Sweden]]. Eventually, there were too many arguments between this denomination and the other American [[Laestadianism|Laestadians]], and some of the followers of Laestadius were excluded from the sacrament of holy communion. Under the lead of Salomon Korteniemi, the excluded members formed a congregation of their own in December 1872, under the name the '''Salomon Korteniemi Lutheran Society'''. In 1879 this name was changed to the '''Finnish Apostolic Lutheran Congregation'''. As other congregations of Finns in [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Oregon]] were organized on the same basis, they came into fellowship with this body under the name the '''Finnish Apostolic Lutheran Church''', or, as it is usually called, the Apostolic Lutheran Church.

The ALCA Laestadians are called "Mickelsens" by other Laestadians, after 20th Century leader Reverend Andrew Mickelsen (1897-1983).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75093116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://extoots.blogspot.fi/2008/08/sports-good-thing_05.html&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is also referred to by members and non-members as the Federation.

== Membership ==
In 2009, membership in the denomination was estimated to include 6,000 baptized members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf LWF Statistics 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821080424/http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf |date=2010-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ministers are mostly lay preachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/Lutheranchurches.pdf A Brief Study of the Lutheran Churches in America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121161735/http://clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/Lutheranchurches.pdf |date=2010-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has sizable congregations in [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[New Hampshire]] and in various other countries, such as [[Canada]] and [[Finland]]. The national organization is governed by an elected board (the Central Board) which meets regularly at various locations across the United States and [[Canada]], and individual member churches are governed by elected boards. The ALCA has no central headquarters facility.

== Doctrine ==
[[File:Amerikan lestadiolaisuuden sukupuu_eng2.png|thumb|Family tree of laestadianism in America. Includes defunct groups.]]
The ALCA narrowly follows the doctrines and practices of [[Laestadianism]]. For example, it emphasizes the necessity of regeneration and the practical importance of absolution from [[sin]]. It follows the Laestadian-specific doctrine of the [[Laestadianism#Declaration of forgiveness|audible declaration of forgiveness of sins]] and encourages avoidance of worldliness and sin. Unlike the two larger branches of Laestadianism, the ALCA does not teach that it is the [[Laestadianism#Exclusion and inclusion among Laestadian sub-groups|only true Laestadian group]].

Liturgically, the church accepts the creeds of the Evangelical [[Lutheran]] church.

The majority of the written doctrine of the Apostolic Lutheran Church is based on [[Luther's Small Catechism]], a collection of [[Martin Luther]]'s teachings.

The '''Association of Confessional Lutheran Churches''' ('''ACLC''') was established in the early part of the 21st century to meet the needs of [[Lutheran]] congregations that departed from the [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] when they considered a [[pastor]] to have been wrongly removed by that body.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theaclc.org/Informative/history_of_the_aclc.htm|title=History of the ACLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The root purpose of the ACLC, then, is to maintain a pool of pastors from which member congregations can call. There are five member [[Local church|churches]].

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=alc}}
'''Association of Free Lutheran Congregations''' is the sixth largest [[Lutheran]] church body in the [[United States]]. The AFLC includes congregations from the former [[Lutheran Free Church]] before 1963, in 27 different states, as well as four [[Canadian province]]s. The AFLC is not an incorporated [[synod]], but a free association. Each local congregation is a separate corporation. [[Minnesota]] is the geographic center of the organization, with over 80 congregations and over 12,000 members.&lt;ref name="RCMS"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/maps/map.asp?variable=67&amp;state=101&amp;variable2=| title = 2000 Religious Congregations and Membership Study|publisher = Glenmary Research Center|accessdate = 2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also numerous congregations in the neighboring states of [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="RCMS"/&gt; The AFLC headquarters are in [[Plymouth, Minnesota]] along with the [[Association Free Lutheran Bible School and Seminary]].

The AFLC logo is the open Bible that is symbolic of God's word as the foundation of faith and life. The Ascending Dove is symbolic of the freedom of congregation, and the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit. The Green Vine is symbolic of the living congregation bearing fruit for God.

==History==
The AFLC was formed by 40 churches in 1962. The churches that formed the AFLC were members of the former [[Lutheran Free Church]] who did not wish to join [[The American Lutheran Church]] in 1963, an earlier merged multi-ethnic denomination formed in 1960. The body was originally called the '''Lutheran Free Church-not merged'''. The ALC filed suit against the group for using the name Lutheran Free Church. By 1964, the name Association of Free Lutheran Congregations was chosen. In 2006, the AFLC had 43,360 baptized members in 267 churches.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1302.asp| title = 2008 ''Yearbook of American &amp; Canadian Churches''|publisher = The National Council of Churches|accessdate = 2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the AFLC had 277 pastors, 280 congregations, and 44,473 members.&lt;ref name=ARDA&gt;{{cite web|title=Lutheran Free Church|url=http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_885.asp|work=American Denomination Profiles|publisher=[[Association of Religion Data Archives]]|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==
The AFLC accept and believe in the Holy Bible as the complete written Word of God, preserved by the Holy Spirit for salvation and instruction. The AFLC accepts the ancient ecumenical symbols, namely, the [[Apostles Creed|Apostles]], the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]], and the [[Athanasian Creed]]s; [[Luther's Small Catechism]] and the unaltered [[Augsburg Confession]] as the true expression of the Christian faith and life.

Five principal reasons for the formation of the AFLC:

*Recognizes the [[Bible]] as the inspired and inerrant authority in all matters of faith and life. 
*Recognizes that the teaching and preaching of God's Word is the main task of the Church, to be conducted in such a way that the saints are built up and unbelievers see their need for salvation. 
*Believes that the congregation is the right form of the Kingdom of God on earth, with no authority above it but the Word and the Spirit of God; 
*Believes that [[Christian]] unity is a spiritual concept, not a man-made organization such as the [[World Council of Churches]] or the [[National Council of Churches]]. 
*Believes that [[Christianity|Christians]] are called to be a salt and light, separated from the ways of the world, and that this difference is to be reflected in the life of the congregation as well as in the institutions of the church body.

The AFLC allows [[open communion]] and [[women's suffrage]] in congregational voting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/Lutheranchurches.pdf A Brief Study of the Lutheran Churches in America]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Committees and corporations==
The AFLC has five corporations that are sponsored by the AFLC to direct their common endeavors: the Coordinating Committee, the Schools Corporation, the Missions Corporation, the AFLC Foundation and the Association Retreat Center (ARC. There are two auxiliary corporations in the AFLC: the Women's Missionary Federation (WMF)  and Free Lutheran Youth (FLY).

===Coordinating Committee===

The coordinating committee consists of seven members from the congregations currently part of the AFLC.  The main duties of the coordinating committee includes monitoring the pastoral roster, monitoring the congregational roster, and providing guidance for the other ministries of the AFLC, including youth, evangalism, parish education, etc.

===Schools Corporation===

The schools corporation's main delegation is the election of the board of trustees, which governs the [[Association Free Lutheran Bible School and Seminary]] (AFLBS).  This corporation consists of fifty members from the congregations of the AFLC. The AFLC leaders came to the consensus to create a Lutheran Bible School patterned after the fundamental teachings of the [[Golden Valley Lutheran College|Lutheran Bible Institute]] founded in 1919.  The school was opened in 1966 with 13 students but grew to 35 the next year.  By the 1990s, the AFLBS was averaging 105 students.  Today there are approximately 200 students attending the school.

===Missions Corporation===

The missions corporation consists of one hundred members of the congregations of the AFLC, and elects from itself a World Missions Committee and a Home Missions Committee, which are involved in the outreach of the AFLC into the [[United States of America|United States]] and several other countries.

===AFLC Foundation===

===Association Retreat Center===
The '''Association Retreat Center (ARC)''' is a separate organization of the AFLC near [[Osceola, Wisconsin]] that serves as a retreat center for various activities within the AFLC.

===Other Committees/Corporations===
The '''Women's Missionary Federation (WMF)''' serves the women of the churches with [[Bible]] studies, fellowship, and has an emphasis on missionary services.

The '''Free Lutheran Youth (FLY)''', is a youth organization dealing with youth ministry.

==Publications==
The official publication of the AFLC is "The Lutheran Ambassador", with twelve issues per year devoted to Bible-centered articles and news of the churches. Ambassador Publications is the parish education department of the AFLC.

The "Ambassador Hymnal" is the [[hymnal]] published by the AFLC, which contains over 600 hymns as well as selected order of church services and responsive Bible readings.

==Annual Conferences==
The AFLC schedules each year a conference to share reports of congregations and other various ministries.  The main reason for these conferences is spiritual edification, as the schedules include prayer times, worship hours, and business meetings together.  It is here that suggestions to changes are presented and discussed.  It is also here that the elections for positions in committees/corporations are made.

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=high_church}}
The '''Augustana Catholic Church''' (ACC), formerly the '''Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church''' (ALCC) and the '''Evangelical Community Church-Lutheran''' (ECCL), is an American [[Church body|church]] in the [[Lutheran]] [[Evangelical Catholic]] tradition. The ACC says it is unique among Lutheran churches in that it is of both Lutheran and Anglo-Catholic heritage and has also been significantly influenced by the Roman Catholic Church. The church was founded in 1997 by former members of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]. Its headquarters are in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://anglolutherancatholic.org/offices/international-headquarters | title = International Headquarters|publisher = The Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ACC has long had a policy of seeking union with the Catholic Church and announced in 2011 that it would accept the conditions of ''[[Anglicanorum coetibus]]'' and join the [[personal ordinariate]]s as they are established. Later developments on limitations of joining the ordinariate caused the ACC to hold their offer while they established intercommunion with groups such as the [[Old Roman Catholic Church of North America]]. The Church claims a membership in excess of 60,000 in 12 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augustanacatholicchurch.co/about-us.html Augustana Catholic Church website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==
The Augustana Catholic Church considers Lutherans to be Catholics in a temporary involuntary [[Schism (religion)|schism]] imposed on it by the Roman Catholic Church when [[Martin Luther]]'s attempt to start a renewal movement within Roman Catholicism slipped out of his control.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | quote = In its first phase, up to the Confession of Augsburg, which was the first synthesis of Lutheranism, Protestantism had no idea of developing into a church other than that of all time, the Catholic Church centered on the See of Rome | first = Louis | last = Bouyer | author-link = Louis Bouyer | title = The Spirit and Forms of Protestantism | page = 268 | place = Princeton, NJ | publisher = Scepter Publishers | year = 2001 | origyear = 1956}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | quote = Luther's basic intuition [the gratuitousness of salvation], on which Protestantism continually draws for its abiding vitality, so far from being difficult to reconcile with Catholic tradition or inconsistent with the teaching of the apostles, was a return to the clearest elements of their teaching and is in the most direct line of that tradition… Protestantism, reduced to what Protestants themselves regard as its essence, was under no necessity to embody itself in schism and heresy… Considered in itself and in the natural course of its development, [the basic principle of the Reformation] does not lead to division and error. These are only the accidental results of the Reformation… [T]he schisms and heresies of the sixteenth century resulted not from the initial impulse but from external and adventitious factors that disturbed its development | page = 62 | first = Louis | last = Bouyer | author-link = Louis Bouyer | title = The Spirit and Forms of Protestantism | place = Princeton, NJ | publisher = Scepter Publishers | year = 2001 | origyear = 1956}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Ells L "Skip" | last = Knox | publisher = Boise State University | url = http://www.boisestate.edu/courses/reformation/luther/29.shtml | title = Martin Luther: Conclusions}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Marius | first=Richard | year=1999 | title=Martin Luther: the Christian between God and Death | publisher=[[Belknap Press]] | location=Cambridge MA | ISBN= 0-674-00387-X | pages= 434, 434–35, 472, 474, 480, 483}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACC teaches that Lutheranism in general is a form of non-Roman Catholicism, and considers the other Lutheran churches to be "[[Protestant]]" only to the extent that they have accepted insights from the [[Calvinist]] and [[Zwinglian]] phases of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Zip | title = US Lutheran Web Links | url = http://www.pastorzip.org/uslutheranlinx.html#evancath | chapter = Evangelical Catholics}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Augustana Catholic Church accepts the [[Augsburg Confession Variata|Unaltered]] [[Augsburg Confession]],&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of prospects for some kind of Roman Catholic recognition of the Augsburg Confession, see [[Richard John Neuhaus]], [http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/oct1980/v37-3-article1.htm "Augsburg and Catholicism: Healing the Reformation Breach,"] ''[[Theology Today]]'' 37, no. 3 (Oct. 1980): 294–305. "In 1974 the idea was first advanced that the Roman Catholic Church should 'recognize' the Augsburg Confession. It received wider attention when Joseph Ratzinger, now Cardinal Archbishop of Munich, took up the possibility of a 'Catholic recognition of the Augsburg Confession or, more correctly, of recognizing the Augsburg Confession as Catholic.'" Neuhaus concluded: "There will be no one act of reunion between the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church; there will at some point be a favorable response from a Lutheran church or churches. With that initiating reunion, the situation of all of Lutheranism will have changed. Lutherans who then care to maintain fellowship with other Lutherans will be inclined, if not compelled, to act out the logic that is inherent in the already prevailing consensus that the interim church called Lutheran must pursue its destiny as a movement for all the church in the healing of the breach of the sixteenth century.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Schreck, "Under one Christ: implications of a Roman Catholic recognition of the Confessio Augustana in CE 2017," ''Journal of Ecumenical Studies'' 43, no. 1 (Winter 2008): 90–110.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]], and Martin Luther's [[Small Catechism]], but only insofar as they are in full agreement with Roman Catholic faith and order, doctrines, and traditions. The ACC recognizes the other documents contained in ''[[The Book of Concord]]''—except for the [[Formula of Concord]]—but only insofar as they are in full agreement with Roman Catholic faith, order, doctrines and traditions. It does not accept the Formula of Concord on any level, nor is it bound by any of its terms and provisions, though it does respect it as a historical Lutheran document.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church | url = http://www.anglolutherancatholic.org/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACC has accepted major modifications in sacramental theology and principles of church government from the [[Church of Sweden]] (Lutheran), the [[Oxford Movement]] of the Anglican Communion, and the documents and teachings of the [[magisterium]] of the Roman Catholic Church which includes the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (1994).

The ACC says it is unique among Lutheran churches in that it accepts, as additional confessional documents, the [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] from the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' as interpreted by [[John Henry Newman]] in ''[[Tracts for the Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;See John Henry Cardinal Newman, [[Tract 90|"Remarks on Certain Passages in the Thirty-Nine Articles,"]] ''Tracts for the Times'', no. XC (1841).&lt;/ref&gt; (insofar as they do not conflict with authentic Catholic faith and tradition); the Roman Catholic–Lutheran ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'' (Augsburg, Germany, 1999);&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Pope Benedict XVI | url = http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2008/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20081119_en.html | title = The Doctrine of Justification: from Works to Faith | date = 19 November 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]; and the documents and decrees of all [[Ecumenical Council]]s recognized by the Roman Catholic Church. The ACC's strongest connections are with the Roman Catholic Church and some form of visible, corporate unity with that church is the ecumenical goal of the ACC.

Since June 2008, all clergy of the ACC are required to sign a version of the Roman Catholic ''mandatum'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = United States Conference of Catholic Bishops | url = http://www.usccb.org/bishops/guidelines.shtml | title = Guidelines Concerning the Academic Mandatum in Catholic Universities (Canon 812)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a legally binding contract requiring the signatories not to teach, preach, write, or publish anything contrary to the magisterium of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

The Augustana Catholic Church accepts [[papal primacy]] and [[papal infallibility]] even though it is not under papal control at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Archdiocese of the West | title = Frequently Asked Questions | contribution = How Is The ACC I is Different From Other Lutheran Churches | url = http://www.augustanacatholicchurch.co}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACC is theologically and socially conservative, with the same view of the nature and authority of [[scripture]] as the Roman Catholic Church as stated in the [[Vatican II]] document, ''The Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation'' - ''[[Dei verbum]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html |publisher=The Vatican |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531175312/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html |archivedate=May 31, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Pontifical Biblical Commission's document, ''The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Pontifical Biblical Commission | url = http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/PBCINTER.htm | title = The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church | date = March 18, 1994 | publisher = EWTN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
The worship of the Augustana Catholic Church is sacramental. It differs from other Lutheran churches by recognizing and celebrating the seven [[sacrament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2SEVEN.HTM | title = The Seven Sacraments | publisher = EWTN}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary [[liturgy]] of the ACC is from the [[Book of Divine Worship]], a book of rites authorized by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and used by [[Anglican Use]] parishes of the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Book of Divine Worship |url=http://www.atonementonline.com/bodw.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220230316/http://www.atonementonline.com/bodw.php |archivedate=2009-02-20 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other rites approved and authorized for use by the Roman Catholic Church may also be used by ACC clergy. Anglican, Lutheran, and other Protestant rites are not authorized for use by ACC clergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/catholic_rites_and_churches.htm | title = Catholic Rites and Churches | publisher = EWTN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polity and organization==
The polity of the Augustana Catholic Church is [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] rather than [[Congregationalist polity|congregationalist]] and follows the model of the Roman Catholic Church. The ACC is governed by a [[Metropolitan Archbishop|metropolitan archbishop]] assisted by a [[vicar general]] and the [[Holy Synod]] (which consists of the bishops of the church and is concerned with matters of doctrine and polity) and the National Standing Committee (which includes lay members and is concerned with temporal administration and finance) and together they comprise the corporate [[Board of Directors]]. The ACC operates in accordance with the 1983 [[Canon law (Catholic Church)#Codification|Code of Canon Law]] of the Roman Catholic Church&lt;ref name="Law"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_INDEX.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law |year=1983 |publisher=The Vatican |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220062727/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_INDEX.HTM |archivedate=February 20, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; in areas not covered by its own canon law code.

The leadership of the Augustana Catholic Church changed on December 1, 2011, with the resignations of its founding metropolitan archbishop and the bishop of the Diocese of Michigan. On December 12, 2011, the Holy Synod (composed of the bishops) of the ACC elected and installed Archbishop Robert W. Edmondson as the church's second metropolitan archbishop.

On 8 April 2012, the ACC underwent a major reorganization by the metropolitan archbishop. It has two dioceses.{{when|date=October 2016}} The Diocese of the Northeast has been renamed the Diocese of the East and given the territory east of the western border of Ontario, Michigan; Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee to the Atlantic Ocean; and also given jurisdiction over the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, and South America. The dioceses formerly having jurisdiction over those areas have been suppressed, and its former diocesan bishops given titular dioceses and positions as bishop directors of the various major church-wide offices in the metropolitan archbishop's curia which are identical in scope and authority to the similar dicasteries in the Roman Catholic Church's curia. The Diocese of the West has been given jurisdiction over the rest of the United States including Alaska and Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean.

On April 24, 2012, Archbishop Edmondson of the Augustana Catholic Church and Archbishop Chris M. Hernandez, Archbishop Co-Adjutor of the North American Old Roman Catholic Church - Utrecht Succession, signed a Concordat of Full Communion and Pledge to Full Unity.

The ACC is a member of the Augustana Catholic Communion, the Sudanese Council of Churches USA and the Sudanese Council of Churches, and is in full communion with the Traditional Church of England, the Anglican Church-Traditional Rite (England, Scotland, and Wales,) the Anglican Church of the Americas, and the North American Old Roman Catholic Church - Utrecht Succession.

==Orders==
Where [[ordination]], the priesthood, the episcopacy, and the papacy are concerned, the ACC rejects the teachings of Lutheranism and accepts all the Roman Catholic teachings. Other than not requiring celibacy of its clergy, there are no differences between the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and those of the ACC regarding the sacrament of [[Holy Orders (Catholic Church)|Holy Orders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm |chapter=The Sacrament of Holy Orders |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |publisher=The Vatican |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111024309/http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm |archivedate=2010-01-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; All ordinations and re-ordinations - without exception - are performed using the rites of ordination found in the most current edition of the Ordinal from the Pontifical of the Roman Catholic Church set within a celebration of the Roman Missal (Third Edition) or the Mass from the Roman Catholic [[Anglican Use]] ''[[Book of Divine Worship]]'' exclusively, with no additions or deletions apart from the deletion of the celibacy vow in the diaconal ordination rite, with the specific intention that ordination is into a sacrificing (sacerdotal) [[priesthood]]—a ''sacerdotium''—instead of into a ''[[ministerium]]''; admitting, both in theory and in practice, all that is involved in the Catholic doctrine of the ''sacerdotium''.

All clergy entering from other churches who have not been ordained in the historic [[apostolic succession]] must be re-ordained. The clergy of the Augustana Catholic Church have all been ordained (or re-ordained) as deacons, priests and bishops in the historic apostolic succession, which it obtained in 2004 from Archbishop [[Peter Paul Brennan]], [[Order of Corporate Reunion|O.C.R]]. of the Ecumenical Catholic Diocese of the Americas&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.ind-movement.org/denoms/ecda_brennan.html | title = ECDA | publisher = Ind Movement}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Archbishops [[Francis C. Spataro]], O.C.R. and [[Paget E. J.

==Petition for unity with the Holy See==
On May 15, 2009, and again in 2014, the Augustana Catholic Church officially filed a formal petition to enter the Roman Catholic Church "as a unified body" in whichever form the Pope and the Curia decides is the most appropriate. The ACC's petition was filed with the Council for Promoting Christian Unity, and is before the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].{{when|date=October 2016}} It is a separate petition from that of the [[Traditional Anglican Communion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=37315&amp;wf=rsscol | title = Are Lutherans Next?

}}The '''Canadian Association of Lutheran Congregations''' ('''CALC''') is a small [[Lutheran]] denomination in Canada. Along with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] and the [[Lutheran Church–Canada]], it is one of only three all-Canadian Lutheran denominations.

==History==
CALC was founded in the early 1990s by a group of Lutherans who strove to keep to keep the authority of [[Bible|Scripture]] central to the life of their churches and their faith. It was formally incorporated by an act of parliament in June 1994. It is today the third largest Lutheran denomination in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calc.ca/QandA_CALC_Dec_%202014.pdf |format=PDF |title='The Little Lutheran Church That Stood' − Q&amp;A's about the Canadian Association of Lutheran Congregations (CALC) |website=Calc.ca |accessdate=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christlutheranmorden.ca/our-history/ |title=Our History |publisher=Christ Lutheran Church, Morden, Manitoba |access-date=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seminary==
The official seminary of CALC is the [[Institute of Lutheran Theology]] (ILT), located in [[Brookings, South Dakota|Brookings]], [[South Dakota]]. In partnership with ILT, it trains all its pastors through a unique program called The Shepherd's Pathway. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calc.ca/pastoraltraining.htm|title=Canadian Association of Lutheran Congregations - Pastoral Training|website=www.calc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=awakening}}
The '''Church of the Lutheran Brethren of America (CLBA)''' is a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] denomination of [[Christian]]s rooted in a spiritual awakening at the turn of the 20th century. A spiritual revival swept through a large part of the [[Midwestern United States]] in the 1890s. Lutherans who were influenced by this fervor rejected several former beliefs as incompatible with their newfound spirituality. They rejected the idea of receiving the unconverted into full membership or admitting them to [[Eucharist|Communion]], replaced liturgical ceremonies with simple worship services, and formed new congregations to worship and serve according to these dictates of conscience. Five such Lutheran congregations from the  [[United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America]] met in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], on December 17, 1900, and organized a synod named the Church of the Lutheran Brethren. Its Constitution was patterned after that of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Free Church of Norway|Lutheran Free Church of Norway]]. The Lutheran Bible School, forerunner of the current schools in [[Minnesota]], was founded in 1903 in [[Wahpeton, North Dakota]].

The CLBA emphasizes the foundational place of the [[Bible]], stating, "We believe the Bible is the [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] Word of God and free from error. It is authoritative for faith and conduct." Other beliefs include the [[Trinity|triune Godhead]]; total depravity; the eternal Son-ship, [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]], sinless life, [[substitutionary atonement]], bodily [[Resurrection of the dead#Resurrection of the dead in Christianity|resurrection]], and personal return of [[Jesus]]; [[infant baptism]]; and [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]]. It has been noted for practicing [[open communion]], teaching [[premillennialism]], and not having the laity receive absolution from the pastor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/Lutheranchurches.pdf A Brief Study of the Lutheran Churches in America]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the denominational statement of faith, the church adheres to the following historic confessions: the [[Apostles' Creed]], [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and [[Athanasian Creed|Athanasian]] Creeds, the ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'', and [[Luther's Small Catechism]]. Its strong emphasis on [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] and [[evangelism]], its stand for non-liturgical worship and a church composed only of confessing Christians differentiates it from most Lutherans in America. The CLBA considers itself to be "Lutheran in theological tradition and evangelical in practice."

The Church of the Lutheran Brethren has 123 congregations with about 8,860 baptized members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf LWF Statistics 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000000/http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf |date=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States (114) and [[Canada]] (9), as well as about 1500 congregations in [[Cameroon]], [[Chad]], [[Japan]] and [[Taiwan]]. Its offices, the [[Lutheran Brethren Seminary]], the Lutheran Center For Christian Learning, and the [[Hillcrest Lutheran Academy]] are located in [[Fergus Falls, Minnesota]]. The CLBA has been led by President Paul Larson since 2014.

The '''Church of the Lutheran Confession (CLC)''' is a conservative [[Christian]] religious body theologically adhering to confessional [[Lutheran]] doctrine.  Founded in 1960 in Minnesota, it has approximately 85 [[parish|congregations]]  in 24 U.S. states, and missions in [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Africa]], [[Nepal]], and [[Myanmar]].

The CLC maintains its headquarters at its ministerial college; [[Immanuel Lutheran College (Eau Claire)|Immanuel Lutheran High School, College &amp; Seminary]] in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]].

==Historical background==
{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=synodical}}
Various Lutheran congregations left their synods during the 1950s and were independent at first. They began meeting together in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Tiefel, Mark. [http://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/31790/Tiefel.pdf?sequence=2 Why Another School?: The Doctrinal History and Reasons for the Formation of Immanuel Lutheran High School, College, and Seminary]. December 10, 2008. p.26&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of the Lutheran Confession (CLC) was formed around the time of the break-up of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America]] in 1963.

The CLC was created primarily (though not solely) from congregations that broke away from the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (ELS) in a disagreement about the application of the principles of [[Christian]] fellowship (in this context, an agreement of a unity of belief). The CLC maintained that the WELS and ELS misapplied those principles by not breaking with the Synodical Conference and the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] after they had publicly recognized doctrinal error within those bodies.

While there were joint talks in the 1990s between the CLC and the WELS and ELS to resolve the dispute, no resolution was reached. Recently, the WELS and ELS have been in formal discussions with the CLC over doctrinal issues. The goal of these discussions is to restore fellowship with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress in doctrinal discussions|url=https://wels.net/progress-in-doctrinal-discussions/|publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|date=September 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510112150/https://wels.net/progress-in-doctrinal-discussions/|archivedate=May 10, 2017|access-date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doctrinal discussions continue between the CLC, the ELS, and WELS|url=https://wels.net/doctrinal-discussions-continue-between-the-clc-the-els-and-wels/|publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|date=December 15, 2015|access-date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of the September meeting of the COP|url=https://wels.net/summary-of-the-september-meeting-of-the-cop/|publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|date=October 4, 2016|access-date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2017 CLC General Pastoral Conference has recommended that the 2018 CLC Convention reject the Joint Statement Regarding the Termination of Fellowship that was proposed in 2015 by the discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=Summer 2017 |title=Panorama - 2017 Church of the Lutheran Confession General Pastoral Conference Recommendation to the 2018 Church of the Lutheran Confession Convention |url=http://clclutheran.org/library/jtheo_arch/jt-2017-vol-057-num-02.pdf#page=36 |journal=Church of the Lutheran Confession's Journal of Theology |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=36–38 |access-date=December 12, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs and practice==

===Core beliefs===
The CLC teaches that the Bible is the only authoritative source for doctrine. It subscribes to the Lutheran Confessions (the [[Book of Concord]], 1580) as an accurate presentation of what Scripture teaches. It is strongly linked to the concept of ''[[sola scriptura]]''—scripture alone, and its website states, "If it is not Scripture; it is not Lutheran."

===Ecumenical relations===
Fellowship between the CLC and other church groups is established only upon investigation and confirmation that both church groups hold complete unity in scriptural doctrine and practice.

The CLC is currently in fellowship with several worldwide synods, some founded through mission work by the CLC.

==Publishing and publications==
The CLC Bookhouse is the official publishing house for the CLC. It is devoted to publishing Christian literature and CLC related religious materials, as well as several CLC periodicals.  The CLC Bookhouse also offers books and items from other publishing houses.

CLC periodicals include:
* ''The Lutheran Spokesman'' — the CLC's monthly family magazine
* ''Ministry by Mail'' — printed and online sermons for CLC members at a distance from their church
* ''The Journal of Theology'' — a quarterly theological magazine
* ''The Witness'' — an e-newsletter 

CLC educational materials include:
* ''God's Hand in our Lives'' — the CLC Sunday School Series
* ''Learn From Me'' — an adult instruction manual

The '''Concordia Lutheran Conference''' is a small organization of Lutheran churches in the [[United States]] which formed in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wuthnow|first1=Robert|title=The restructuring of American religion society and faith since World War II|date=1989|publisher=Princeton Univ.

It is the remaining successor of the Orthodox Lutheran Conference. The current president is the Reverend Edward J. Worley, pastor of St. Luke's Lutheran Church in Seattle, Washington. All members of the board of directors serve one year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSTITUTION of the CONCORDIA LUTHERAN CONFERENCE|url=http://www.concordialutheranconf.com/doctrine/constitution.cfm|website=www.concordialutheranconf.com|accessdate=8 December 2014|location=ARTICLE XI -- TERM OF OFFICE|quote=Officers and members of standing committees shall be elected to hold office for one year}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in fellowship with 7 mission congregations in [[Russia]] and [[Nigeria]].

Scriptural Publications, the publishing arm of the Concordia Lutheran Conference, has just published an anthology, ''Historical Essays'' by Rev. David T. Mensing: "The Missouri Synod's Slide into Heterodoxy, 1932-1947"; "The Establishment of Heterodoxy in the Missouri Synod, 1950"; and "The Founding of the Orthodox Lutheran Conference, 1951".

==History==
In 2004, the CLC absorbed the congregations of the '''Fellowship of Lutheran Congregations'''. The FLC was organized in 1979, when a group of Lutheran congregations left the [[Lutheran Churches of the Reformation]] over issues of excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordialutheranconf.com/2015/07/02/iintroducing-the-pastors-of-the-f-l-c-n/|title=Introducing The Pastors of The F.

==Teachings==
The Conference describes itself as "orthodox," with special emphasis on the inerrant, literal interpretation of the Christian [[Bible]]. The Concordia Lutheran Conference subscribes to the [[Book of Concord]] and the ''Brief Statement of the Doctoral Position of the Missouri Synod'' in its doctrinal stance.

==Purpose==
The Conference is a gathering of churches to engage in tasks that would be hard for any one church to perform.&lt;ref name=WhatIsClC&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Concordia Lutheran Conference?|url=http://www.concordialutheranconf.com/|website=concordialutheranconf.com|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the training of future pastors in their seminary program.&lt;ref name=WhatIsClC /&gt;

The '''World Confessional Lutheran Association''' was established in 1965 by a group of pastors and lay people who were concerned about trends in the [[American Lutheran Church]] and other synods which were contrary to what they believed were the historical beliefs and practice of Lutheranism.

In 1980 through the involvement of Lutherans Alert National the group was renamed '''Conservative Lutheran Association''' (CLA)..&lt;ref name=ARDA&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservative Lutheran Association|url=http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1295.asp|work=American Denomination Profiles|publisher=[[Association of Religion Data Archives]]|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trinity"&gt;{{cite web|title=The CLA|url=http://www.tlcanaheim.com/cla|publisher=Trinity Lutheran Church and Christian School|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has 994 baptized members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf LWF Statistics 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000000/http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf |date=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a member of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/Lutheranchurches.pdf A Brief Study of the Lutheran Churches in America]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eielsen Synod''' (originally named the '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in America''') was a [[Lutheran]] [[church body]]. It was founded in 1846 at [[Jefferson Prairie Settlement]], [[Wisconsin]] by a group of [[Haugean|Haugean Lutherans]] led by [[Elling Eielsen]].

==Background==
There were church splits in 1848 and 1856. In 1876 the synod  numbered 24 pastors, 59 congregations, and 7,500 members. That year a major split occurred and many of the clergymen and congregations left the Eielsen Synod and organized the [[Hauge Synod]]. Elling Eielsen and his supporters continued the synod under the 1846 church constitution in [[Jackson, Minnesota|Jackson]], [[Minnesota]]. 

The Eielsen Synod emphasized the importance of repentance, conversion, and lay preaching. It opposed ritualism, formal worship, clerical vestments, and clerical authority. The Eielsen Synod had 1,500 members in ten churches in 1953. By 1971, it had declined to 75 members scattered among churches in [[French Lake Township, Minnesota|French Lake]] and [[Jackson, Minnesota]]; [[Centerville, South Dakota]]; and [[Taylor, Wisconsin|Taylor]] and [[Lodi, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_281.html ''Major Branches of Religions Ranked by Number of Adherents'' (Adherents.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, there were approximately 50 members at just three churches: Stall Norwegian Church in [[Jackson, Minnesota]]; Bethania Lutheran in [[Lodi, Wisconsin|Lodi]]/[[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]]; and Immanuel in [[French Lake Township, Wright County, Minnesota|French Lake, Minnesota]]. Immanuel is now an independent Lutheran church. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cokatomuseum.org/immanuel.html ''A Synod Of One: The Story Of Immanuel Lutheran Church'' (Karen Christofferson. "In The Midst Of" December 1999. V. 19 No. 4)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Eielson Synod is still in existence with a minister ordained on May 10, 2008 by the presiding president of Bethania ELCA-Eielson Church. Martin Leroy Bystol was the active President of such ministry of the Eielsen Synod until his death. Rev Orvin L. Bystol is an ordained minister and resides in Eau Claire, where the church is located.

The '''Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church''' (Estonian: ''Eesti Evangeelne Luterlik Kirik'', abbreviated ''EELK'') is a [[Lutheran]] church in [[Estonia]]. EELC is member of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] and belongs to the [[Community of Protestant Churches in Europe]]. It is also a member of the [[Porvoo Communion]], putting it in [[full communion]] with the [[Church of England]] and other Anglican churches in Europe.

==History==
The Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church (EELC) was constituted in 1949, when the previous church hierarchy, ''Eesti Evangeeliumi Luteriusu Kirik'', headed by [[bishop]] [[Johan Kõpp]], had escaped to [[Sweden]] in 1944. When the [[Soviet Union]] invaded Estonia in 1940, most Christian organizations were dissolved, church property was confiscated, theologians were exiled to [[Siberia]], and religious education programs were outlawed. [[World War II]] later brought devastation to many church buildings.  It was not until 1988 that church activities were renewed when a movement for religious tolerance began in the Soviet Union.

Although women had studied [[theology]] at [[Tartu University]] in the 1920s and some had sought ordination as priests, it was not until 1967 that the first woman, [[Laine Villenthal]], was ordained. In 2014, the church reported that there were 169 men and 43 women serving as ministers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Leadership==
The Church of Estonia is episcopal in polity, and is led by five bishops, including the archbishop who serves as the [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]].&lt;ref&gt;Bishops named [http://www.eelk.ee/kirik/meie-vaimulikud/piiskopid/ here] (Estonian).&lt;/ref&gt; The archbishop has overall control, and under his authority there are four jurisdictions, each with its own Bishop.

Following the retirement of [[Andres Põder]] as archbishop, the current archbishop is Urmas Viilma, consecrated on 2 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Consecration date stated [http://www.eelk.ee/kirik/meie-vaimulikud/piiskopid/peapiiskop-urmas-viilma/ here] (Estonian).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Soviet occupation of Estonia, the Archbishop went into exile, which resulted in the formation of a parallel church, the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church Abroad. Until 2010 this body was independent, with its own Archbishop based in Canada. In 2010 the two churches reunited, and the former overseas church became a [[diocese]] of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church, known as the Extra-Estonian Diocese ({{lang-et|Välis-Eesti piiskopkond}}).&lt;ref&gt;Details of reunion at [https://www.oikoumene.org/en/member-churches/estonian-evangelical-lutheran-church World Council of Churches] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
As of February 2009, the EELC reported approximately 160,000 baptized members and the EELC Abroad (based in Canada) reported approximately 8,000 baptized members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf LWF Statistics 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821080424/http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf |date=August 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A previous figure broke down the EELC Abroad into 3,508 members with 12 clergy in the USA and 5,536 members with 11 clergy in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/Lutheranchurches.pdf A Brief Study of the Lutheran Churches in America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121161735/http://clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/Lutheranchurches.pdf |date=2010-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Lutheran World Federation reported the number of registered members as being 180,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Churches in Estonia|url=https://www.lutheranworld.org/country/estonia|website=lutheranworld.org|publisher=Lutheran World Federation|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church reported that it had served 143,895 communicants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Social issues== 
The church has both theologically conservative and liberal members.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.postimees.ee/3003191/no-obvious-option-for-lutheran-archbishop|title=No obvious option for Lutheran archbishop - Local News - Estonian news in English|website=Postimees|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church does ordain women to the priesthood, unlike the more conservative [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia]] and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Lithuania]]. In an interview, Archbishop [[Urmas Viilma]] stated that the church allows women ordination and "will continue to do so". The church also disapproves homosexual unions, believing marriage is the sacred union of a man and a woman. It only allows celibate gay ministers to be ordained. However, Archbishop Viilma did state that if same-sex marriage is legalized in the country, "then the church will clearly need to redefine itself", but he also stated that "we clearly interpret the Bible to say that practicing homosexuality is sin...but we all are equal in God’s eyes an welcome in church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koch|first1=Tuuli|title=All have sinned|url=http://news.postimees.ee/3007237/all-have-sinned|website=postimees.ee|publisher=Postimes|accessdate=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lutherans leaned toward opposing the death penalty, although they took no official stance, and the church does not have a committee "dealing with social-political questions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDrihdh-TiIC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;dq=Estonian+Lutherans+on+social+issues&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-YQb7WgmBk&amp;sig=PlEDvD4nJCPSUJWb1a70FdR06NU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXyPGw4efMAhUm3IMKHY7yDwIQ6AEIQzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Estonian%2520Lutherans%2520on%2520social%2520issues&amp;f=false|title=The Politics of Religion in Russia and the New States of Eurasia|last=Bourdeaux|first=Michael|date=1995-01-01|publisher=M.E.

The '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in America''' ('''ELCA''') is a [[mainline Protestant]] [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Christian Church|Church]] headquartered in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The ELCA officially came into existence on January 1, 1988, by the merging of three Lutheran church bodies. {{As of|2016}}, it has approximately 3.5 million baptized members in 9,252 congregations.&lt;ref name="elca stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/News-and-Events/ELCA-Facts|title=ELCA Facts|work=ELCA.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Pew Research estimated that 2.1 percent of the U.S. population self-identifies with the ELCA and mainline Lutheranism.&lt;ref name="Religious Landscape Study"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Landscape Study|url=http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/|website=pewforum.org|publisher=Pew Research|accessdate=February 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the seventh-largest religious body&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://www.wfn.org/2010/02/msg00100.html |title=NCC's 2010 Yearbook chronicles church trends | publisher = WFN | date = February 12, 2010 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The ELCA belongs to the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Lutheran World Federation]]. The ELCA is in [[full communion]] with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], [[Moravian Church in North America|Moravian Church]], [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], [[Reformed Church in America]], [[United Church of Christ]], and the [[United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elca.org/Faith/Ecumenical-and-Inter-Religious-Relations/Full-Communion|title=Full Communion Partners|website=ELCA.org|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=mainline}}
In 1970, a survey by Strommen et al. found that 79 percent of Lutheran Church in America clergy, 62 percent of American Lutheran Church clergy, and 58 percent of Lutheran Church Missouri Synod clergy surveyed agreed that "a merger of all Lutheran groups in the United States into one organization is desirable".&lt;ref&gt;For laity, the figures were 70 percent LCA, 70 percent ALC, and 62 percent LCMS. Including clergy and laity, 4,745 Lutheran adults between the ages of 15 and 65 were surveyed. See Merton P. Strommen et al., A Study of Generations (Minneapolis: Augsburg Publishing, 1972), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; The ELCA formally came into existence on January 1, 1988, creating the largest Lutheran church body in the United States. The Church is a result of a merger among  The American Lutheran Church (ALC) with its headquarters in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], the Lutheran Church in America (LCA) (centered in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]) and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (AELC) (which had earlier withdrawn from the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] after 1975), all of which had formally agreed in 1982 to unite after several years of discussions. The ALC and LCA were themselves the product of previous mergers.&lt;ref&gt;See Lowell Almen, ''One Great Cloud of Witnesses'', (Minneapolis:Augsburg Fortress, 1997) p.9-12 for a brief recounting of the formation of the ELCA; or the [http://www.elca.org/communication/roots.html Roots of the ELCA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403112446/http://www.elca.org/communication/roots.html |date=April 3, 2007 }} is available online (retrieved March 27, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The American Lutheran Church===
In 1960, [[American Lutheran Church|The American Lutheran Church]] was formed as a merger of the earlier [[American Lutheran Church (1930)|ALC]] of 1930 from [[Germany|German]] heritage,the [[United Evangelical Lutheran Church]] (UELC) of [[Denmark|Danish]] background, and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church (United States)|Evangelical Lutheran Church]] (ELC) of [[Norway|Norwegian]] background. The [[Lutheran Free Church]] (LFC) joined three years later in 1963. The ALC brought approximately 2.25 million members into the new ELCA. It was the most theologically conservative of the forming bodies, having a heritage of [[Old Lutherans|Old Lutheran]] theology.&lt;ref name="The Lutherans in North America"&gt;Nelson, E. Clifford. [https://books.google.com/books?id=q3xyPFA_8O0C&amp;pg=PA509#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Lutherans in North America]. Revised ed. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1980. p. 509&lt;/ref&gt; It had been in fellowship for a decade with the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod and officially held to [[biblical inerrancy]] in its constitution, although it seldom enforced that stance by means of heresy trials or other doctrinal discipline. Its geographic center was in the [[Upper Midwest]], especially [[Minnesota]], with headquarters and publisher ([[Augsburg Publishing House]]) on South Fifth Street in [[Minneapolis]] and one of its several seminaries in neighboring [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. Its denominational magazine was ''The Lutheran Standard'', published in Minneapolis. Some congregations in the ALC opted not to join the 1988 merger and instead formed the [[American Association of Lutheran Churches]].

===The Lutheran Church in America===
[[File:Evangelical Lutheran on East Church Street - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Evangelical Lutheran Church (Frederick, Maryland)]] (1752)]]
The [[Lutheran Church in America]] (LCA) had been created in 1962, when the [[United Lutheran Church in America]], (itself created by the merger of three earlier German Lutheran synods in the eastern U.S. in 1918), along with the [[Sweden|Swedish]] background [[Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church]], the [[Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]], and the [[Denmark|Danish]] immigrants in the [[American Evangelical Lutheran Church]]. The LCA was the slightly larger partner and brought approximately 2.85 million members into the new ELCA. Their administrative offices were in the Church House, a former townhouse mansion on Madison Avenue in [[New York City]]. Its publishing house, [[Fortress Press]], was on Queen's Lane in northwest [[Philadelphia]], and produced the church magazine, ''The Lutheran''. Its demographic focus was on the East Coast, centered on [[Pennsylvania]]), with large numbers in the Midwest and some presence in the [[South Atlantic States|Southern Atlantic]] states. There are notable exceptions, but LCA-background churches tend to be more liturgical than ALC-background churches. Its theological orientation ranged from moderately liberal to [[neo-orthodox]], with tendencies toward conservative [[Pietism]] in some rural and small-town congregations. Its theology originated in the [[Neo-Lutheranism|Neo-Lutheran]] movement.&lt;ref name="The Lutherans in North America"/&gt;

===The Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches===
In 1976, the [[Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches]] (AELC) was formed by 250 congregations that had left the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) in a [[Seminex|schism]] precipitated by disputes over [[biblical inerrancy]] and [[Ecumenism|ecumenism]] as part of the overall [[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy]] that was roiling American [[Protestant]] churches for several decades. The LCMS elected more conservative leadership in 1969 under President [[J. A. O. Preus II|Jacob A.O. Preus]], replacing moderate incumbent [[Oliver Harms]]. The new leadership opened an investigation at the synod's [[Concordia Seminary]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], about the faculty's commitment to inerrancy in Biblical interpretation. As a result, most of the faculty and student body walked out and established a separate institution named "Concordia Seminary-in-Exile" (but usually referred to as "[[Seminex]]"). The AELC brought approximately 100,000 members into the ELCA. Its immigrant heritage came mostly from [[Germany]] in the mid-19th century; the complexion of its theology generally resembled that of the LCA.

==Organization==
[[File:Mark hanson.jpg|upright|thumb|ELCA's then-Presiding Bishop [[Mark Hanson]] speaking at the inauguration of a new [[Augsburg College]] president in 2006]]
The ELCA is headed by a [[Presiding Bishop]], who is elected by the Churchwide Assembly for a term of six years (it was a four-year term until 1995). To date, four people have been elected to the position of Presiding Bishop of the ELCA. [[Herbert W. Chilstrom]] served as the first Presiding Bishop from 1987 to 1995. He was followed by [[H. George Anderson]] (1995–2001), who had previously been the President of [[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]]. The third Presiding Bishop was [[Mark Hanson]], who is the past president of the [[Lutheran World Federation]], headquartered in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Hanson began his tenure as Bishop of the Church in 2001 and was re-elected in August 2007 for a second term. [[Elizabeth Eaton]] was elected Presiding Bishop in August 2013 and took office on November 1, 2013.

In addition, there is the body of the Church Council composed of representatives elected for a stated number of years from the various synods which meet regularly with legislative powers in between sessions of the Churchwide Assemblies.

The Conference of Bishops, which meets at least twice a year, is formed of 66 bishops (the 65 elected synodical bishops, together with the presiding bishop) plus the ELCA church secretary. It is consulted by the Presiding Bishop and the Church Council for advice on matters of doctrine, faith and order, and ecumenical relations. The ELCA website states that "While primarily advisory, the role of the Conference of Bishops is significant within the life of this church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elca.org/About/Leadership/Conference-of-Bishops |title = Conference of Bishops |last= |first= |author= |date= |year= |publisher = ELCA |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 23 August 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of ELCA regions.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|A map of the nine ELCA regions. Note that the Slovak Zion Synod falls under Region 7 and the [[Bahamas]] and the Caribbean under Region 9.]]
The ELCA is divided into [[List of ELCA synods|65 synods]], one of which is non-geographical (the [[Slovak Zion Synod]]) and 64 regional synods in the United States and the Caribbean, each headed by a synodical bishop and council; these synods are in turn grouped into nine regions.&lt;ref&gt;For further information about the ELCA's structure and organization, see [http://www.elca.org/secretary/constitutions/ConstitutionsBylawsandContinuingResolutions2005.pdf 2005 ELCA Constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317002930/http://www.elca.org//secretary/constitutions/ConstitutionsBylawsandContinuingResolutions2005.pdf |date=2007-03-17 }} (pdf document, retrieved March 27, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ELCA the term ''synod'' refers to the [[middle judicatory]], which is referred to in some other denominations as "presbyteries", "districts", "conferences" or "dioceses" (the most ancient and traditional term). In other Christian churches, the term "synod" is used for a meeting or conference of ministers such as priests or bishops of a diocese, province (region)  or nation or in some Protestant churches as the term for their annual governing convention. Some Evangelical Lutheran denominations overseas continue to use the ancient church title of "diocese".

Outside of the United States, ELCA also has congregations in the [[Caribbean]] region ([[Bahamas]] which is combined with Florida in one synod, [[Bermuda]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]]) and one congregation in the border city of [[Windsor, Ontario]], a member of the [[Slovak Zion Synod]]. Before 1986, some of the congregations that form the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] were part of the ELCA's predecessor churches.

Within the church structure are divisions addressing many programs and ministries. Among these are support for global mission, outdoor ministries, campus ministries, social ministries, and education. They include the [[Lutheran Peace Fellowship]], [[Lutheran Women's Caucus]], [[Lutheran Volunteer Corps]], and the Lutheran Youth Organization [[ELCA Youth Gathering]] (formerly known in predecessor denominations as the [[Luther League]]). They cooperate with an ecumenical inter-Lutheran college/university student organization known as the [[Lutheran Student Movement-USA]] founded in 1922 and reorganized in 1969. The denominational publishing house is [[Augsburg Fortress]], and the official denominational magazine is ''[[Living Lutheran]]''. ELCA predecessor bodies established twenty-six [[List of ELCA colleges and universities|colleges and universities now affiliated with the ELCA]] and a large number of associated theological seminaries, some of which are associated with neighboring universities or theological consortia.

Most local congregations are legally independent non-profit corporations within the state where they are located that own their own property. Actual governing practice within the congregation ranges from congregational voters' assemblies or annual and special congregational meetings to elder-and-council-led, to congregations where the senior pastor wields great, if informal, power (more common in larger churches).&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.elca.org/secretary/constitutions/congregations/index.html Model Constitution for Congregations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317002942/http://www.elca.org//secretary/constitutions/congregations/index.html |date=2007-03-17 }} (retrieved March 27, 2007) - especially Chapter 5 "Powers of the Congregation" and Chapter 7 "Property Ownership".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Churchwide Assemblies===
The Churchwide Assembly meets biennially in odd-numbered years and consists of elected lay and ordained voting members; between meetings of the Churchwide Assembly, the ELCA Church Council governs the denomination, along with the advisory Conference of Bishops. At the Assembly, elections are held for general officers of the Church such as the Presiding Bishop, Vice President and Secretary, budgets are adopted, social statements examined and approved and various other church business enacted along with reports made and ecumenical visitors acknowledged. A constitutional amendment passed in 2011 that will switch it to a triennially meeting after 2013. In both predecessor churches, the Assembly was known as the "General Convention" in The ALC and the "Biennial Convention" in the LCA.

==Beliefs==

===Lutheranism===
Lutheranism is associated with the German reformer [[Martin Luther]], with its official confessional writings found in the [[Book of Concord]]. The ELCA accepts the unaltered [[Augsburg Confession]] (not the [[Augsburg Confession Variata|variata]]) as a true witness to the [[Good news (Christianity)|Gospel]]. The ELCA is less [[conservatism|conservative]] than the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) or the even more conservative [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS), the second and third largest Lutheran bodies in the United States respectively.&lt;ref&gt;See also http://archive.elca.org/questions/, {{cite web |url=http://archive.elca.org/communication/brief.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207120421/http://archive.elca.org/communication/brief.html |archivedate=2009-02-07 |df= }} and http://archive.elca.org/communication/faith.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although having a sizable conservative minority, most ELCA Lutherans are theologically moderate-to-liberal. Most other Lutheran bodies in the U.S. hold more strictly to [[Confessional Lutheranism]], [[Pietism]], or a combination of the two, than the ELCA does.

===Differences within the ELCA===
The ELCA has many differences of opinion among its constituent congregations, which have caused a number of disputes over social and doctrinal issues. In part, this is due to the fact that it assimilated three different Lutheran church bodies, each with its own factions and divisions, thus inheriting old intra-group conflicts while creating new inter-group ones. Differences on issues usually reflect theological disputes between various parties.

The ELCA is a very broad denomination. It contains groups of socially conservative or liberal factions with emphases on various topics such as [[liturgical renewal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valpo.edu/ils |title=Institute of Liturgical Studies |institution=Valparaiso University |publisher= |work=Valpo.edu |date=2013-07-18 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cimino, Richard. Lutherans Today, Eerdmans: Grand Rapids, 2003, 81-101.&lt;/ref&gt; confessional Lutheranism, charismatic revivalism, moderate to liberal theology, and liberal activism. The socially liberal segment of the ELCA is represented by independent organizations such as [[Lutherans Concerned/North America]], [[Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries]], and the [[Evangelical and Ecumenical Women's Caucus]]. A socially conservative Lutheran organization, once within, and now departed from the ELCA opposed to the denomination's stance on openly gay clergy is the [[Lutheran CORE|Lutheran Coalition For Renewal]] (Lutheran CORE). Adherents of [[Evangelical Catholic]]ism practice [[High Church Lutheranism]] and include the members of the [[Society of the Holy Trinity]]. Those oriented toward Confessional Lutheranism, [[Evangelicalism]], or an admixture of the two include the [[WordAlone]] network and those involved with [[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]]. Members of the [[Charismatic Movement]] include congregations and pastors associated with the [[Alliance of Renewal Churches]]. Additionally, there has been a recent growth in Franciscan spirituality in the ELCA through the [[Order of Lutheran Franciscans]].

===Scripture===
The ELCA constitution states: "This church accepts the canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the inspired Word of God and the authoritative source and norm of its proclamation, faith, and life."&lt;ref&gt;For more information on the history and current documents of the ELCA, look at other resources linked to the "About the ELCA" section of the [ELCA] http://www.elca.org Web site. See the series of essays, "With Confidence in God's Future" for more on ELCA's ecumenical outlook. Get it in [Word]http://archive.elca.org/communication/WithConfidence.doc, or [PDF]http://archive.elca.org/communication/WithConfidence.pdf format.&lt;/ref&gt;

ELCA clergy tend not to subscribe to a doctrine of [[Biblical inerrancy]], but see validity in various [[Higher criticism|scholarly methods]] of analysis to help in understanding the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.elca.org/What-We-Believe/New-or-Returning-to-Church/Dig-Deeper/The-Bible.aspx The Bible] on the ELCA website or [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=H&amp;word=HIGHERCRITICISM Higher Criticism] in the Christian Cyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in concord with most moderate Protestant bodies and in contrast to the LCMS and WELS, which practice the [[historical-grammatical method]] of biblical interpretation.

===Sacraments===
Like other Lutheran church bodies, the ELCA confesses at least two [[Sacrament]]s: [[Eucharistic theology#Lutherans|Communion]] (or the [[Eucharist in the Lutheran Church|Eucharist]]) and [[Baptism#Reformation|Holy Baptism]] (including [[Infant baptism#Lutherans|infant baptism]]). Confession and absolution is often included as a Sacrament; however, as it is a return to the forgiveness given in baptism, strictly speaking there are only two sacraments. Guidance on sacramental practices in the ELCA is provided in ''The Use of the Means of Grace'', a statement adopted by the 1997 Churchwide Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Learning-Center/The-Use-of-the-Means-of-Grace.aspx  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015095945/http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Learning-Center/The-Use-of-the-Means-of-Grace.aspx |date=October 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the two sacraments, ELCA churches also practice acts that are sacramental in character, or [[Sacramentals#Protestant usages|sacramentals]]. These include [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|confirmation]], [[holy orders|ordination]], [[extreme unction|anointing the sick]], [[Confession in the Lutheran Church|confession and absolution]], and [[marriage]]. Their practice and their view as "minor sacraments" varies between churches of a "[[High Church Lutheran|high]]" and "low" church nature.

With respect to the eucharist, the ELCA holds to the Lutheran doctrine of the [[sacramental union]], that is, that Christ's body and blood is truly present "in, with and under" the [[Sacramental bread|bread]] and wine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookofconcord.org/sd-supper.php#para38 The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord, Article 8, The Holy Supper, paragraph 38].&lt;/ref&gt; All communicants [[Human mouth|orally]] receive not only bread and wine, but also the same body and blood of Christ that was given for them on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. unaltered [[Augsburg Confession]], [http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article10 Article 10: Of the Lord's Supper].&lt;/ref&gt; Members of other denominations sometimes refer to this as a belief in [[consubstantiation]]. Lutherans, however, [[Sacramental union#Distinction from other doctrines of the Real Presence|reject the philosophical explanation of consubstantiation]], preferring to see the presence of the Lord's body and blood as mysterious rather than explainable by human philosophy. The Lutheran belief in the mysterious character of the consecrated bread and wine is more similar to Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox belief than most Protestants. In contrast, most Protestant church bodies doubt or openly deny that the true body and blood of Christ is eaten in the Lord's Supper.

Unlike certain other American Lutheran church bodies, the ELCA practices [[open communion]], permitting all persons baptized in the name of the Trinity with water to receive communion. Some congregations also [[Infant communion|commune baptized infants]] similarly to Eastern Orthodox practice. The ELCA encourages its churches to practice the Eucharist at all services, although some churches alternate between non-communion services with those containing the Lord's Supper.

===Social issues===
The ELCA's stances on social issues are outlined in its Social Statements and Messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/Faith/Faith-and-Society|title=Faith and Society|work=ELCA.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social Statements, which must be adopted by a two-thirds majority of a Churchwide Assembly, have been adopted on the following topics:

{{div col end}}

====Role of women====
The ELCA [[ordination of women|ordains women as pastors]], a practice that all three of its predecessor churches adopted in the 1970s. Some have become synod bishops. In 2013, Elizabeth Eaton became the first woman to be elected Presiding Bishop of the ELCA. The most recent ELCA hymnal, ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'', includes alternate gender-neutral invocations and benedictions in all settings. All of the psalms and many of the hymns and parts of the liturgy have been altered to remove masculine pronouns referring to God.&lt;ref&gt;ELCA/ELCiC Celebrate New Hymnal. ''The Lutheran Hedgehog 1''(5). Sept.-October 2006. p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Cooperative Clergy Study Project surveyed 681 ELCA pastors and found that 95 percent of ELCA clergy thought that all clergy positions should be open to women, while 2 percent disagreed.&lt;ref name="thearda.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/COOPCLER.asp|title=Summary - The Cooperative Clergy Study Project - Data Archive - The Association of Religion Data Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ordination of LGBT clergy and blessings of same-sex marriages====
{{Main article|2009 ELCA Churchwide Assembly}}

On August 21, 2009, the ELCA's Churchwide Assembly in Minneapolis voted to allow congregations to call and [[Ordination of LGBT Christian clergy|ordain gays and lesbians]] in committed monogamous relationships to serve as clergy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elca.org/What-We-Believe/Social-Issues/Social-Statements/JTF-Human-Sexuality.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105063915/http://www.elca.org/What-We-Believe/Social-Issues/Social-Statements/JTF-Human-Sexuality.aspx|date=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By a vote of 559 to 451, delegates approved a resolution declaring that the church would find a way for people in "publicly accountable, lifelong, monogamous same-gender relationships" to serve as official ministers. Congregations that do not wish to call these persons to ordained ministry are not required by these policy changes to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/us/22lutherans.html?hpw | work=The New York Times | title=Lutheran Group Eases Limits on Gay Clergy | first1=Michael | last1=Luo | first2=Christina | last2=Capecchi | date=August 22, 2009 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction, [[Lutheran CORE]], which opposed the decision, stated that it would "initiate a process that we hope will lead to a reconfiguration of North American Lutheranism."&lt;ref&gt;Spring, Paull W. ''Update on Lutheran CORE's Convocation'' Accessed online on September 27, 2009 at [http://www.lutherancore.org/papers/spring_pre_convoc_ltr.shtml http://www.lutherancore.org/papers/spring_pre_convoc_ltr.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, [[Lutheran CORE]] announced that it would secede from the ELCA and form a new denomination to be named the [[North American Lutheran Church]] (NALC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lutherancore.org/papers/new_vision.shtml "A Vision and Plan for ''The North American Lutheran Church'' and ''Lutheran CORE''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304071324/http://www.lutherancore.org/papers/new_vision.shtml |date=2010-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2008}}, 37 percent of ELCA pastors were found to support [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert P.

The ELCA, in removing sexual orientation as a bar for candidacy in the professional ministry, joined most of its Lutheran sister churches in Europe, including in Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, and Austria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordelbien.de/nachrichten/newsne.1/one.news/index.html?entry=page.newsne.201101.32] Accessed 17 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The ELCA is also among a growing number of Christian churches in the United States to make this move.

In contrast, the board of one of the ELCA's partner churches, October 2009, the [[Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus|Evangelical Mekane Yesus Fellowship in North America]], voted to declare disunity with the ELCA. A press release stated that the board was no longer "in good conscience" "able to commune and partner with ELCA Church that has willfully disobeyed the word of God and regrettably departed from the clear instructions of the Holy Scriptures" that "marriage is only between a man and a woman."&lt;ref name="christianpost.com"&gt;[http://www.christianpost.com/news/ethiopian-church-severs-ties-with-lutherans-over-homosexuality-89745/ Ethiopian Church Severs Ties With Lutherans Over Homosexuality] Accessed March 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the general synod of  [[Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus]] also breaking links with the ELCA.&lt;ref name="christianpost.com"/&gt;

In April 2010, The Church Council of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America adopted revisions to ministry policy documents to bring them in line with the August 2009 vote, as well as adding sections on integrity, substance abuse and addiction.&lt;ref name="release_april_2010"&gt;{{Cite press release

&lt;/ref&gt;
The release noted that the [http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Vocation/Rostered-Leadership/Ministry-Policies.aspx revised ministry policies] would be posted on the church's website by the end of April 2010.&lt;ref name="release_april_2010"/&gt;

Since August 2009, according to the office of the ELCA secretary, over 600 congregations have left the ELCA through January 2011. Income has declined, with a projected income of 48 million in 2011, down from a budgeted 51 million in 2010, and a total budget of 88 million in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Communication-Services/News/Releases.aspx?a=4698#&amp;&amp;a=4682] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121091051/http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Communication-Services/News/Releases.aspx?a=4698#&amp;&amp;a=4682|date=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 31, 2013, [[Guy Erwin]] became the first openly gay man to be chosen bishop in the ELCA when he was elected to a six-year term as bishop of the Southwest California Synod.&lt;ref name="Erwin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2013/06/lutheran-assembly-elects-first-openly-gay-bishop|title=Lutheran assembly elects first openly gay bishop|date=June 1, 2013|accessdate=June 3, 2013|publisher=[[The Virginian-Pilot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the denomination ordained, officially, the first transgender pastor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/religion/2015/07/06/meet-first-trans-pastor-officially-ordained-evangelical-lutheran-church|title=Meet the First Trans Pastor Officially Ordained by the Evangelical Lutheran Church|date=2015-07-06|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2015, after the Supreme Court legalized [[Obergefell v. Hodges|same-sex marriage]] nationally in the US, the office of the presiding bishop released a letter informing members that each congregation is free to marry gay and lesbian couples or to choose not to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/News-and-Events/7759|title=ELCA presiding bishop offers letter on Supreme Court marriage ruling|website=www.elca.org|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009 [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|blessings of same-sex marriages]] are allowed in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/same-sex-unions-accepted-by-evangelical-lutherans/nQM5R/|title=Same-sex unions accepted by Evangelican Lutherans|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creation and evolution====
The ELCA has not adopted an official position on [[creationism|creation]] or [[evolution]], but there is general agreement on interpreting the Bible within its historical contexts and applying critical methods of research. In 2000, the Cooperative Clergy Study Project surveyed 681 ELCA pastors and found that 26 percent of ELCA clergy thought [[Creationism#Christianity|Scientific Creationism]] should be taught alongside evolution in biology classes, while 57 percent disagreed.&lt;ref name="thearda.com"/&gt;

====Reproductive cloning====
The ELCA has not yet taken an official position regarding reproductive cloning. However, Task Force on Genetics of the church's "Church in Society" initiative is studying the theological and ethical issues that the world is likely to face in coming years as a result of Genetic Science. The task force has issued a draft report&lt;ref&gt;Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Draft Social Statement on Genetics to be considered by the 2011 ELCA Churchwide Assembly, March 2010, http://www.elca.org/What-We-Believe/Social-Issues/Social-Statements-in-Process/Genetics/Draft-Social-Statement.aspx
&lt;/ref&gt; for comment and discussion. The draft statement covers a wide range of topics, from [[genetic testing]] to [[Genetically modified organism|GMOs]]. A section in this report which has been described by an independent reviewer as "a remarkably nuanced analysis and statement regarding a very complex scientific, social, and religious issue."&lt;ref name="Eigen"&gt;Lewis D. Eigen, "Rights &amp; Protections of Coming Human Clones: A Remarkable Lutheran View", Scriptamus, March 19, 2010, http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2010/03/19/rights-protections-of-coming-human-clones-a-remarkable-lutheran-view/#more-475&lt;/ref&gt; The task force recommends opposition to reproductive cloning, as almost all religious groups currently do. However, the main theological reasoning is unique. Lewis D. Eigen explains:&lt;ref name="Eigen"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The argument they articulate is not the common but weak argument that it would be "offensive to God," "against the will of God" or "man encroaching into God's domain", but they observe that the clone would be denied the dignity of possessing a unique human genotype. This is an extremely interesting argument—that each and every human being has the right to his or her own uniqueness—particularly a unique genotype.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The draft statement further asserts that any clones that might be created should have full acceptance as human beings and access to rites of the church.

====Abortion====
The issue of [[Abortion debate|abortion]] is a matter of contention within the ELCA. In a Social Statement adopted in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elca.org/What-We-Believe/Social-Issues/Social-Statements/Abortion.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327042724/http://www.elca.org/What-We-Believe/Social-Issues/Social-Statements/Abortion.aspx|date=March 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the church set out its position on the matter as follows. The ELCA describes itself as "a community supportive of life," and encourages women to [[Crisis pregnancy center|explore alternatives]] to abortion such as [[adoption]]. However, the Social Statement asserts that there are certain circumstances under which a decision to end a [[pregnancy]] can be "morally responsible." These include cases where the pregnancy "presents a clear threat to the physical life of the woman," situations where "the pregnancy occurs when both parties do not participate willingly in sexual intercourse," and "circumstances of extreme fetal [[Disability|abnormality]], which will result in severe suffering and very early death of an infant." Regardless of the reason, the ELCA opposes abortion when "a fetus is [[Viability (fetal)|developed enough to live outside a uterus]] with the aid of [[Neonatal intensive-care unit|reasonable and necessary technology]]." The ELCA opposes "laws that deny access to safe and affordable services for morally justifiable abortions," and "laws that are primarily intended to harass those contemplating or deciding for an abortion."  The statement emphasizes the prevention of circumstances leading to abortion, specifically encouraging "appropriate forms of [[Sex education#United States|sex education]] in schools, community [[Christian views on contraception#Lutheranism|pregnancy prevention]] programs, and [[parenting]] preparation classes." In 2000, the Cooperative Clergy Study Project found that one fifth of ELCA clergy favored banning abortion with a constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4QI_eBpD7twC&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pulpit and Politics: Clergy in American Politics at the Advent of the Millennium] edited by Corwin E. Smidt&lt;/ref&gt;

====Euthanasia====
The ELCA official statement on "End of Life Decisions", adopted on November 9, 1992, disapproves euthanasia: "We oppose the legalization of [[physician assisted suicide|physician-assisted death]], which would allow the private killing of one person by another. Public control and regulation of such actions would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. The potential for abuse, especially of people who are most vulnerable, would be substantially increased."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/What-We-Believe/Social-Issues/Messages/End-of-Life-Decisions.aspx|title=Page Not Found|work=ELCA.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry==
[[File:Richard and bonnie jensen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|ELCA ministers [[Richard A. Jensen|Richard]] and [[Bonnie L. Jensen|Bonnie Jensen]]]]
As a Lutheran church body, the ELCA professes belief in the "[[priesthood of all believers]]" as reflected in Martin Luther's [[To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation]], that all baptized persons have equal access to God and are all called to use their gifts to serve the body of Christ. Some people are called to "rostered ministry", or vocations of church leadership and service. After formation, theological training, and approval by local synods these people are "set aside, but not above" through ordination or commissioning/consecration.&lt;ref&gt;Information on the Division's work and the various types of rostered ministry can be found at the [http://www.elca.org/ministry/ Division's webpage].&lt;/ref&gt; More and more ELCA congregations are employing specialized and even general ministers outside of this national oversight.

An extensive "Study of Ministry" was embarked upon immediately after the 1988 merger as it became apparent that there were still discordant viewpoints and influences, especially by the pressure for a renewal of the office of deacon and its different manifestations to a more ancient and traditional view predating the Reformation into the earliest days of Christianity. The church makes a clear distinction between the deacon's "Ministry of Word and Service", and the Pastor's "Ministry of Word and Sacrament".

In ELCA the word ordination refers specifically to the setting apart of an ordained pastor in the ministry of word and sacrament. The similar rite for setting apart a bishop is called installation, and the rite for setting apart a deacon is called consecration. All three rites (for bishops, pastors, and deacons) are formal liturgies, with prayer and the laying-on of hands by the bishop, or by the Presiding Bishop in the case of the installation of a new bishop. The ELCA now (since 2000) requires all installations of new bishops to include the laying-on of hands by not fewer than three bishops who are known to be within the historic line of [[apostolic succession]].

===Deacons===
Deacons are called to a "Ministry of Word and Service".&lt;ref name=MWS&gt;{{cite web |url = http://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/Consecration_Ministry_Word_Service.pdf |title = Consecration to the Ministry of Word and Service |last= |first= |author= |date= |year= |publisher = ELCA |location= |page= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |access-date = 23 August 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former lay rosters of deaconess, diaconal minister, and associate in ministry were all merged onto one roster, called Deacons, beginning in January 2017.  

Deacons serve in many roles in and beyond congregations. At their consecration they may be presented with a towel and basin (in reference to Jesus washing the feet of his disciples) as a sign of their servant ministry, but the rite of consecration (published in January 2017) also allows for other symbols to be presented, reflecting the broad range of diaconal service. The rite states: "Other symbols of the ministry of word and service may be given, which may reflect a particular focus of the deacon’s call and vocation, such as a vessel containing oil, a Bible, or the book of worship."&lt;ref name=MWS/&gt;

===Pastors===
An ordained minister is called to the "Ministry of Word and Sacrament" and considered a "steward of the mysteries" of the Church (the [[means of grace]]). Pastors primarily serve congregations, but some serve in sector ministries including those of hospital [[chaplain]] and military chaplain.

Pastors are ordinarily trained at one of [[List of ELCA seminaries|eight ELCA seminaries]] located throughout the United States, although there are alternative paths for ordination to serve particular communities in which it is difficult to provide trained leaders or to allow rostering of clergy transferred from other denominations. Pastors generally hold a Bachelor of Arts degree or its equivalent, as well as a four-year [[master of divinity]] degree. They are required to learn biblical [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and spend at least a summer doing clinical pastoral education — an intensive program that gives them time to reflect on their pastoral craft, usually in a hospital setting. They are required to complete a one-year internship of full-time service in pastoral ministry.

===Bishops===
A [[bishop]] is a pastor called to serve (usually for a six-year term, which may be renewed) as the senior pastor of a [[synod]], or called to serve as the [[presiding bishop]] of the ELCA.

The [[Called to Common Mission]] agreement with the Episcopal Church in 2000 means that bishops are now ordained in the Apostolic Succession and remain permanently in that office for life. The fixed term of service as head of a synod has not changed, and there was no requirement in 2000 for existing ELCA bishops to be re-ordained within the historic episcopate; instead, the apostolic succession was received as a sign of historic continuity, without denying the traditional Lutheran belief that the Church is truly present where the sacraments of baptism and holy communion are administered, regardless of the historic nature (or otherwise) of the ministry. Before 2000 a pastor had served in the office of bishop and then returned to being known simply as a pastor when service as a bishop had ended. Following the 2000 agreement a former bishop may still return to the work of a local pastor, but he or she now retains the status of bishop, even if not exercising that ministry.

==Worship==
Published in 2006, ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'' is the main [[hymnal]] used in congregations. Some congregations, however, continue to use the older ''[[Lutheran Book of Worship]]'' published by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in 1978, and some even continue to use the older ''[[Service Book and Hymnal]]'' (SBH) of 1958 or its antecedent precedent-setting ''[[Divine Service (Lutheran)|Common Service]]'' of 1888 which laid out a traditional American Lutheran liturgy and later was included in subsequent worship books and hymnals of various churches especially ''[[Divine Service (Lutheran)|The Common Service Book]]'' of 1917, adopted by the old [[United Lutheran Church in America]], a predecessor of the LCA to 1962, and ''The Lutheran Hymnal'' (TLH-1941) of the LCMS. Many congregations also make use of supplementary resources recently published as well besides those authorized for the ''LBW'' by Augsburg-Fortress, Publishers. Many ELCA congregations are classically [[liturgical]] churches. Their liturgy is rooted in the Western liturgical tradition, though recent international Lutheran-Orthodox dialog sessions have had some minimal influence on Lutheran liturgy. Because of its use of the [[Book of Concord]] of 1580, with the Confessions, documents and beliefs of the Reformers, including the [[Augsburg Confession]] of 1530, [[Luther's Small Catechism]] of 1529 and the [[Luther's Large Catechism|Large Catechism]] and its retention of many pre-Reformation traditions, such as [[vestment]]s, [[feast days]] and the celebration of the [[Liturgical year|Church Year]], the [[Sign of the cross#Lutheranism|sign of the cross]], and the usage of a church-wide [[Agenda (liturgy)|liturgy]], there are many aspects of the typical ELCA church that are very catholic and traditional in nature. Many Evangelical Lutheran churches use traditional vestments ([[cassock]], [[surplice]], [[stole (vestment)|stole]] for services of the Word or non-Eucharistic liturgies or [[alb]], [[cincture]], [[stole (vestment)|stole]], [[chasuble]] (pastor) or [[dalmatic]] (deacon), [[cope]] (processions) for Eucharists (Mass, Holy Communion), etc.). On special rare occasions even a bishop's cross/[[crozier]] and [[mitre]] (bishop's headpiece) have been used to designate the ancient robes and traditions of the Church originating in [[Holy Roman Empire|Roman]] times of which [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and his fellow Reformers like [[Philip Melanchthon]] considered as "adiaphora" or of permissive use. Since the [[Second Vatican Council]] of the 1960s, most major parts of the ELCA's popular liturgies are worded exactly like the English language Mass of 1970 of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Many ELCA congregations use informal styles of worship or a blend of traditional and contemporary liturgical forms.

Springing from its revered heritage in the [[Lutheran chorale]], the musical life of ELCA congregations is just as diverse as its worship. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], the most famous Lutheran composer and African songs are part of the heritage and breadth of Evangelical Lutheran church music. The musical portion of the Lutheran liturgy includes [[metrical psalter]], metrical responses and hymns. ''Evangelical Lutheran Worship'' has ten settings of Holy Communion, for example. They range from plainsong chant, to Gospel, to Latin-style music. Congregations worship in many languages, many of which are represented in ''Evangelical Lutheran Worship''. Other books used in ELCA churches include the ''[[Lutheran Book of Worship]]'' (1978), and its supplements: ''With One Voice'', ''This Far by Faith'', and for Latino/Hispanic congregations: ''Libro de Liturgia y Cántico''.

==Ecumenical relations==
The ELCA is a member of the [[National Council of Churches]], the [[World Council of Churches]], and [[Christian Churches Together]] and is a "partner in mission and dialog" with the [[Churches Uniting in Christ]] (formerly the Consultation on Church Union) formed in 1960.

===Full communion===
The Church maintains [[full communion]] relationships with other member churches of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] (which is a communion of 140 autonomous national/regional Lutheran church bodies in 78 countries around the world, representing nearly 66 million Christians) which was reorganized in 1948 from the earlier [[Lutheran World Convention]] of 1923. Also the ELCA has established official relationships with other Christian denominations such as the [[Moravian Church in America]], the [[Presbyterian Church USA|Presbyterian Church (USA)]], the [[Reformed Church in America]], the [[United Church of Christ]], [[The Episcopal Church]], and The [[United Methodist Church]].

In 2013, the [[Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus]] severed ties, including communion and pulpit fellowship, with the ELCA over the issue of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/ethiopian-church-severs-ties-with-lutherans-over-homosexuality-89745/|title=Ethiopian Church Severs Ties With Lutherans Over Homosexuality|access-date=2016-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholic Church===
On October 31, 1999, in [[Augsburg]], Germany, the Lutheran World Federation – of which the ELCA is a member – signed the ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'' with the Roman Catholic Church. The statement is an attempt to reconcile a historical theological divide between the two faiths. The ''Declaration'' also states that the mutual condemnations between 16th century Lutherans and the Roman Catholic Church no longer apply to those that have signed onto the document. This was part of a series of "Lutheran-Roman Catholic Dialogues" have been taking place on an official basis every few years with statements and booklets on various theological topics published since 1966.

===Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
The differences between the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) arise from theological, historical, and cultural factors. The LCMS was briefly in fellowship with the former The American Lutheran Church, one of the ELCA predecessor bodies from 1969 to the early 1980s. Although the denominations cooperate through [[Lutheran World Relief]] and some university/college student ministries and military chaplaincy, they are not officially in communion with each other.

When the first Lutheran immigrants came to North America, they started church bodies that reflected, to some degree, the churches they left behind in Europe. Many maintained until the early 20th century their immigrant languages. They sought pastors from the "old country" until patterns for the education of clergy could be developed here. Eventually, [[seminaries]] and church colleges were established in many places to prepare pastors to serve congregations.

The earliest predecessor synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was constituted on August 25, 1748, in Philadelphia under the influence of [[Henry Muhlenberg]], known as the "Patriarch of American Lutheranism". It was known as the [[Ministerium of Pennsylvania|Ministerium of Pennsylvania and Adjacent States]]. The earliest nationwide "synod" or "union of synods" was established in 1820 as the [[General Synod (Lutheran)|General Synod]], followed later by the [[General Council (Lutheran)|General Council]]. The ELCA was created in 1988 by the merging of the 2.85-million-member Lutheran Church in America (1962), 2.25-million-member The American Lutheran Church (1960), and the 100,000-member Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches (1978). Previously, the ALC and LCA in the early 1960s came into being as a result of two mergers of eight smaller ethnically based Lutheran bodies composed of German, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Slovak, Dutch, and others organized over 150 years. Some of these smaller ethnically based bodies previously had ecumenical arrangements involving the Missouri Synod.

The LCMS was established in 1847 by German immigrants fleeing the forced [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Prussian Union]] between Lutherans and Reformed church members in European Germany, who later settled in [[Perry County, Missouri]]. It grew through immigration, offspring, and church mergers while participating in some, but not all of the dialogues, controversies, and compromises which affected the various predecessors of the ELCA during the 19th and 20th Centuries. In the mid-1970s the [[Seminex]] controversy at their Concordia Seminary in St. Louis over use of historical-critical biblical study led to the formation of the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, later one of the predecessor bodies of the ELCA. The LCMS is the second largest Lutheran church body in North America with 2.1 million adherents.

The ELCA tends to be more involved in ecumenical endeavors than the LCMS, which prohibits its clergy from worshiping in ecumenical gatherings. The ELCA is a member of the [[Lutheran World Federation]], [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[National Council of Churches|National Council of Churches of Christ, USA]]. The LCMS rejects these as being [[indifferentism|unionist]].

Both the LCMS and the ELCA have policies relating to clergy sexual misconduct. Perry C. Francis, a former ELCA pastor turned professor, along with psychology professor Tracy D. Baldo, published the results of their 1994 study of clergy sexual misconduct in the journal ''Pastoral Psychology''. Out of 270 ELCA and 117 LCMS clergy surveyed, 13.7 percent of ELCA clergy and 4.3 percent of LCMS clergy admitted to sexual misconduct with another person since they began their ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, Perry C. Baldo, Tracy D.

The '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada''' ('''ELCIC''') ({{lang-fr|Église évangélique luthérienne au Canada}}) is [[Canada]]'s largest [[Lutheran]] denomination, with 111,570 baptized members in 519 congregations,&lt;ref&gt;http://elcic.ca/Parochial-Reports/documents/2015-ELCICAnnualSummary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with the second largest, the [[Lutheran Church–Canada]], having 60,291 baptized members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutheranchurch-canada.ca/resources/2014_Summary_of_Statistics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the LCC and the [[Canadian Association of Lutheran Congregations]], it is one of only three all-Canadian Lutheran denominations. It is a member of the [[Lutheran World Federation]], the [[Canadian Council of Churches]], and the [[World Council of Churches]]. According to the 2011 Canadian census, a larger number of 478,185 adherents identify as Lutheran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 National Household Survey|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/130508/dq130508b-eng.htm?HPA|website=statcan.gc.ca|publisher=Canadian Census|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada came into being in 1986 through the merger of two predecessor bodies the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Canada]] (started in 1966 by Canadian congregations of the [[American Lutheran Church]]) and three [[synod]]s of the [[Lutheran Church in America]], called the Canada Section. (In 1988 these two US church bodies ceased to exist as they merged into the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the ELCIC's sister denomination in the United States.)

The Church derives its teachings from the [[Bible]] and the [[Book of Concord]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://elcic.ca/Resources/documents/ELCICConstitution-2007.pdf ELCIC Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the three ecumenical creeds of the Christian Church—that is, the [[Apostles' Creed]], the [[Nicene Creed]] and the [[Athanasian Creed]]. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada is in full communion with the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] under the [[Waterloo Declaration]].  [[Waterloo Lutheran Seminary]] and [[Lutheran Theological Seminary, Saskatoon]] are the seminaries owned by the church.

==Organisation==

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada is composed of five synods (similar to a [[diocese]] in [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[ecclesiastical polity|polity]]). The presiding officer and chief pastor of each synod is a bishop.
*The [[British Columbia Synod]]
*The [[Synod of Alberta and the Territories]]
** [[Robert Jacobson]]{{Dash}} first bishop (1985–1995)
*The [[Saskatchewan Synod]]
*The [[Manitoba/Northwestern Ontario Synod]]
*The [[Eastern Synod]]

This structure is identical to the synod structure of the ELCA, except that the Canadian synods cover one or more entire provinces, whereas some ELCA synods cover the whole or part of a metro area and some cover several states. Like the ELCA a [[presiding bishop]] serves as its head, but in the ELCIC, this bishop is known as the "National Bishop". Although episcopal in structure, the church does not have cathedrals as such, though the largest parish church in a city may well have that de facto function with respect to major worship services involving the whole Lutheran community.

==National Bishops==

*Rev. [[Donald Sjoberg]], 1986–1993
*Rev. [[Telmor Sartison]], 1993–2001
*Rev. [[Raymond Schultz (bishop)|Raymond Schultz]], 2001–2007
*Rev. Canon [[Susan Johnson (bishop)|Susan Johnson]], 2007-

==Same-sex unions==

In 2006, the Eastern Synod voted to allow individual pastors and congregations to conduct [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches |blessing of same-sex unions]], prompting a dispute between the synod and the national church over which body has the authority to make such a decision. The national church had previously voted against blessings, and the ELCIC's full communion partner, the Anglican Church of Canada, had voted to defer a decision. On June 23, 2007, at its National Convention, the ELCIC voted, by a 200–181 vote margin, against authorizing the Synods to devise individual mission strategies in regard to ministering to people who live in committed same-sex relationships, including the possibility of blessing such unions. The Eastern Synod Council, while affirming its jurisdiction in the matter, agreed to hold its decision in abeyance pending a decision by the national church.
 
In July 2011, the National Convention of the ELCIC adopted a new social statement on human sexuality and approved a motion allowing pastors whose conscience permits, in consultation with their congregations, to preside at marriages for same-gender couples. Some have claimed that the adoption of "ELCIC Social Statement on Human Sexuality" openly violates Article 2 of the ELCIC constitution, and have challenged the adoption as a violation of the ELCIC's constitution. A challenge was placed before the ELCIC's Court of Adjudication. The Court found that the complainant did not have the status required by the Constitution to press the complaint and declined to hear the complaint. As a result of the 2011 vote and the court's decision, the ELCIC today permits the blessing of same-sex unions and the ordination of openly gay or lesbian pastors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/faith/evangelical-lutherans-back-same-sex-marriage-126053333.html|title=Evangelical Lutherans back same-sex marriage|website=www.winnipegfreepress.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=high_church}}
The '''Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of North America''' ('''ELDoNA''') is a [[confessional Lutheran]] church body in the [[United States]]. There are seventeen pastors in the diocese, serving congregations in Alaska, Arkansas, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://web.mac.com/hunnius/ELDoNA/Links.html | publisher = ELDoNA| title = Congregations}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ELDoNA was founded June 6, 2006 at a meeting held at Salem Lutheran Church, [[Malone, Texas]]. A second diocesan synod was held August 28 and 29, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://web.mac.com/hunnius/ELDoNA/2007_Colloquium_and_Synod.html | publisher = ELDoNA| year = 2007 | title = Colloquium &amp; Synod}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The third diocesan synod was held at Christ Lutheran Church in [[Richmond, Missouri]] on May 22, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://web.mac.com/hunnius/ELDoNA/2008_Synod.html | publisher = ELDoNA| year = 2008 | title = Colloquium &amp; Synod}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourth in the same location, May 14–15, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://web.mac.com/hunnius/ELDoNA/2009_Synod_%26_Colloquium.html | publisher = ELDoNA| year = 2009 | title = Colloquium &amp; Synod}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For the fifth Colloquium and Synod, the diocese returned to Malone, Texas, May 12–15, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://web.mac.com/hunnius/ELDoNA/2010_Colloquium_%26_Synod.html | publisher = ELDoNA| year = 2010 | title = Colloquium &amp; Synod}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and met there again for the sixth Colloquium and Synod May 11–13, 2011. The sixth Colloquium and Synod was the first in which all but one of the pastors of the diocese and the entire clergy of the [[Association of Confessional Lutheran Churches]] (ACLC) were in attendance. Among the significant decisions of the 2011 synod was the resolution to open a diocesan seminary in September 2012; the 2012 synod chose to delay that planned opening to 2014. The 2012 synod took place at Salem Lutheran Church in Malone, Texas the week of April 23–27, 2012, and the 2013 synod took place April 29–May 3, 2013.

In August 2013 the ACLC broke fellowship with the ELDoNA due to the latter's stand on the doctrine of Objective Justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the ACLC|url=http://theaclc.org/Informative/history_of_the_aclc.htm|publisher=Association of Confessional Lutheran Churches|accessdate=January 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, James Heiser was called to serve as the diocesan bishop. Heiser has published a volume of essays on the doctrine of the holy ministry entitled ''Stewards of the Mysteries of God''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rutowicz|first1=John|title=Stewards of the Mysteries of God|date=2011|publisher=Repristination Press|location=Texas|isbn=978-1-891469-41-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also the author of a study of the neo-Platonic revival which took place during the Italian Renaissance, entitled ''Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rutowicz|first1=John|title=Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century|date=2011|publisher=Repristination Press|location=Texas|isbn=978-1-4610-9382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Repristination Press published a volume of essays by Pastor John Rutowicz which sets forth the diocesan understanding of the episcopal office: ''Holding Fast the Faithful Word: Episcopacy and the Office of the Holy Ministry in the Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of North America''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rutowicz|first1=John|title=Holding Fast the Faithful Word: Episcopacy and the Office of the Holy Ministry in the Evangelical Lutheran Diocese of North American|date=2013|publisher=Repristination Press|location=Texas|isbn=978-1891469466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diocese produces ''The Lutheran Herald'', a monthly devotional journal that also includes diocesan news.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://eldona.org/the-lutheran-herald | publisher = ELDoNA| title = Lutheran Herald}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Evangelical Lutheran Synod''' ('''ELS''') is a US-based [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] [[religious denomination|denomination]] based in [[Mankato, Minnesota|Mankato]], [[Minnesota]]. It describes itself as a [[Conservatism|conservative]], [[Confessional Lutheran]] body. The ELS is in fellowship with the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) and is a member of the international [[Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference]] (CELC).
{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=synodical}}

==Core beliefs==
The Evangelical Lutheran Synod teaches that the Bible is the only authoritative and error-free source for doctrine. It subscribes to the Lutheran Confessions (the [[Book of Concord]]) not in-so-far-as but because it is an accurate presentation of what scripture teaches. It teaches that Jesus is the center of scripture and the only way to eternal salvation, and that the Holy Spirit uses the gospel alone in Word and Sacraments (Baptism and Holy Communion) to bring people to faith in Jesus as savior and keep them in that faith, strengthening them in their daily life of sanctification.

==Membership==
There are approximately 19,394 baptized members&lt;ref name="members"/&gt; in 142 established congregations and 12 mission churches. The current president is John Moldstad, who has been serving since 2002. Note that the ELS uses the term ''[[synod]]'' differently from the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] and is a separate denomination.

==History==
[[File:HAPreus.JPG|thumb|left|190px|[[Herman Amberg Preus]], (1825–1894), a key figure in organizing the Norwegian Synod.]]
The Evangelical Lutheran Synod traces its history back to 1853 when the "[[Norwegian Synod]]" was organized in the Midwestern United States. They practiced "fellowship", a form of [[full communion]], with the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) during the 1850s and 1860s. In 1872, they along with the LCMS and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) formed the [[Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America]].

In 1917, the Norwegian Synod merged with  two other Norwegian Lutheran groups and formed the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church (United States)|Norwegian Lutheran Church of America, later named the Evangelical Lutheran Church]]. This led to disagreement among members of the Norwegian Synod. The people who became the ELS had concerns regarding fellowship with those who did not share the same doctrine. The Norwegian Synod had taught that conversion and salvation were entirely the work of God without any cooperation from humans. The new merged church allowed that conversion depended in some degree on humans accepting God's grace. A group of people  therefore gathered at Lime Creek Lutheran Church near [[Lake Mills, Iowa]], on June 14, 1918, and reorganized as the '''Norwegian Synod of the American Evangelical Lutheran Church''' (also known as "Little Norwegian" Synod)  The name was later changed to the '''Evangelical Lutheran Synod''' on June 25, 1957. 

In 1955 the ELS suspended its fellowship with the LCMS over doctrinal disagreements, and in 1963 it withdrew from the [[Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America]]. It retained its fellowship with the WELS. (The WELS severed its fellowship relations with the LCMS in 1961, and also withdrew from the Synodical Conference in 1963.)

In 1993, the ELS and WELS, working with a number of other worldwide Lutheran churches, some of which had been founded through mission work by both synods, founded the [[Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference]] (CELC).

==Hymnal==
The '''''Evangelical Lutheran Hymnary''''' (''ELH'') is a hymnal created by the Evangelical Lutheran Synod in 1996.

The Norwegian heritage of the ELS is evident in this hymnal, although a broader ethnicity is clearly represented. From the indexes located in the back of the hymnary, on pages 926ff entitled "Translated Hymns", it is clear that the majority of the hymns come from German, Scandinavian and Latin sources, however Greek, Czech, French, and other sources are also present.

The cover of this hymnary is black with a gold imprinted logo on the front cover. The logo used is a Latin cross with budded arms superimposed over a lyre, on a diamond-shaped background. Inside these covers one finds more than hymn texts: The Church Year is summarized; followed by the full texts of the [[Augsburg Confession]]; the texts of the [[Apostles' Creed]], the [[Nicene Creed]], and the [[Athanasian Creed]]; and the [[Luther's Small Catechism|Small Catechism]] by Dr. [[Martin Luther]]. Prayers are included as well as four different rites of The Divine Service. ''The Divine Service: Rite One'' is based on the ''Danish Ritual of 1685''; ''The Divine Service Rite Two'' is from the ''Common Service'' from 1888; ''The Divine Service: Rite Three'' is a new setting by Dr. Alfred Fremder; and ''The Divine Service: Rite Four'' is the ''Lutheran "Chorale Mass"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blc.edu/comm/gargy/gargy1/ELH.ELS.report.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913003036/http://www.blc.edu/comm/gargy/gargy1/ELH.ELS.report.html |archivedate=2009-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Other services included here are The Office of the Prime, Matins, Vespers, Compline, and others. A Service of Private Confession and Absolution is also included. Psalms, canticles, and other resources are also found here.

While most American Lutherans are familiar with a joint confession of sins followed by a spoken absolution from the pastor, this hymnary features an optional Individual Absolution (on page 43). Before each worshipper hears the word of absolution, the pastor says, "Upon this your confession, come forward to the altar of the Lord and receive the declaration of the forgiveness of all your sins. ''The communicants come forward and kneel at the altar rail.''"

A total of 602 hymns appear in this work. Some appear merely as lyrics with only a suggested tune listed, others include musical notation. The text is enriched by language like that in the New King James Version.

==Education ministries and missions==
[[File:2009-0805-BLC-OldMain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bethany Lutheran College]] in Mankato, Minnesota]]
In 1927, the ELS formed [[Bethany Lutheran College]] in [[Mankato, Minnesota|Mankato]], [[Minnesota]]. In 1946, it established its own seminary, also in Mankato, called [[Bethany Lutheran Theological Seminary]]. Throughout its history, ELS congregations have actively sponsored Christian elementary schools. The synod carries on an active home mission program and now has more than 140 congregations in many states. It also has foreign missionaries laboring in Peru and Chile in South America and in Ukraine, Latvia, and the Czech Republic in Eastern Europe.

The '''General Lutheran Church''', Inc. is a small Lutheran denomination&lt;ref&gt;ELCA Yearbook Committee, ''Evangelical Lutheran Church in America 2018, Augsburg Fortress Publishers, Minneapolis, November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; organized on March 9, 2014, and incorporated in the State of Indiana on October 26, 2017.&lt;ref name="in"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bsd.sos.in.gov/PublicBusinessSearch/BusinessInformation?businessId=1220832&amp;isSeries=False|website=bsd.sos.in.gov|title=INBiz: Your one-stop source for your business.|accessdate=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded when ministers of four other Lutheran church bodies who objected to various positions held in their respective churches, specifically regarding atonement, women's ordination, worship styles, and the ''[[Lutheran Confessions]]'', met to discuss these and other issues of concern. This meeting led to the establishment of the General Lutheran Church and to its endorsement of universal salvation, women's ordination, and flexibility with regards to liturgical matters. The church claims to be a successor to the former [[Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of the United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.generallutheran.info|title=General Lutheran Church|website=www.generallutheran.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theological statement ==
The General Lutheran Church values the ''Lutheran Confessions'' as expressed in the ''[[Book of Concord]]'', other works by [[Martin Luther]], and the writings of [[Samuel Simon Schmucker]] as theological guides, and allows its ministers and congregations the liberty of conscience to interpret and apply the teachings of the ''Lutheran Confessions''. The church also supports the right and duty of private judgment in the interpretation of the Scriptures. The denomination does, however, expect congregations and ministers to abide by the following set of beliefs:

* *Belief in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. -- John 1:18
* *Belief that Jesus Christ is the Lord and Savior of all. -- First Corinthians 15:22
* *Belief that the Bible is a sufficient guide for faith and practice. -- Matthew 4:4
* *Belief in two Sacraments: Holy Baptism and Holy Communion. -- Mark 22:14-20
* *Belief in the just retribution for sin. -- Colossians 3:25
* *Belief that there is a wideness in God's mercy. -- Ephesians 2:4-7

The denomination bases its belief on universal salvation from Martin Luther's statement, "God forbid that I should limit the time of acquiring faith to the present life. In the depth of the Divine mercy, there may be an opportunity to win it in the future,"&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Martin; Atkinson, James, Editor. ''Luther's Works, Volume 44: Christian in Society I'', p. 428. Fortress Press, Minneapolis, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; and from the New Testament: "And when I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone to myself"(John 12:32), "Everyone will see the salvation of God" (Luke 3:6), and "Our hope is set on the living God, who is the savior of all people, especially those who believe" (1 Timothy 4:10).

==Polity==
The General Lutheran Church is a semi-congregationalist denomination headed by the General Leadership, which consists of the General Minister and the General Pastor. The General Minister is the presiding officer, executive administrator, and spiritual leader of the denomination. The General Minister is invested with the responsibility of ensuring the purpose and mission of the General Lutheran Church are carried out and that the Statement of Faith and the general principles of the Christian faith are adhered to. Responsibilities include overseeing and regulating issues related to the administrative, legislative, ministerial, evangelistic, educational, missionary, benevolent and other interests of the denomination.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution and Bylaws of the General Lutheran Church&lt;/ref&gt; The General Pastor is appointed by the General Minister and serves to assist, advise, and counsel the General Minister. The General Pastor has no decision-making powers. All final decisions regarding polity and procedure belong exclusively to the General Minister. The National Leadership exercises no control or authority over individual congregations or pastors and only serve in an advisory capacity. The National Leadership assists pastors in crisis situations or by request.

==Pastoral training==
The General Lutheran Institute of Pastoral Theology offers free certificate courses in systematic theology, Lutheran history, pastoral counseling, biblical languages, pastoral theology, and the Lutheran confessions to meet the academic requirements for ordination as a General Lutheran minister.&lt;ref&gt;http://generallutheran.info/institute-of-pastoral-ministry.&lt;/ref&gt; The courses are taught by qualified faculty who all hold degrees from institutions accredited by agencies recognized by the United States Department of Education or hold accredited status in their respective countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://generallutheran.info/faculty.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social statement ==
The General Lutheran Church is opposed to same-sex marriage, the ordination of practicing gays and lesbians, and abortions not medically necessary. However, engaging in abusive or malicious behaviors towards the gay and lesbian community, all immigrants, and those who have made the difficult decision to have an abortion are prohibited. The denomination condemns racism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and all other types of hate and discrimination at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.generallutheran.info/|title=General Lutheran Church|website=www.generallutheran.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2018}}

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=awakening}}
[[File:Amerikan lestadiolaisuuden sukupuu_eng2.png|thumb|Family tree of laestadianism in America. Includes defunct groups.]]
The '''Laestadian Lutheran Church''' (LLC) is a religious Christian movement, its teachings based on the [[Bible]] and the [[The Book of Concord|Lutheran Confessions]].  From June 9, 1973, the organisation was named the '''Association of American Laestadian Congregations''' (AALC), before the association changed its name in 1994 in order better to convey its spiritual heritage. {{As of|2016}}, the Laestadian Lutheran Church has 33 member congregations in the United States and Canada, with highest concentrations of members in [[Minnesota]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Arizona]], [[Michigan]] in the United States and in [[Saskatchewan]], Canada; the congregations are served by a bit over 100 ministers, nearly all of them [[lay preacher]]s.

In Northern Europe, the association's sister organizations are the [[Conservative Laestadianism|Conservative Laestadians]]' [[The Central Association of the Finnish Associations of Peace|Central Association of the Finnish Associations of Peace]] (''{{lang|fi|Suomen rauhanyhdistysten keskusyhdistys}}'') in [[Finland]], the [[Sveriges fridsföreningarnas centralorganisation]] in Sweden, and the [[Estonian Lutheran Association of Peace]] (''{{lang|et|Eesti Luterlik Rahuühendus}}'').

The main teaching among them is of [[Jesus]]' suffering, death, and resurrection. The work of Jesus Christ continues in this world as the work of the [[Holy Spirit]]. The Laestadian Lutheran Church teaches of God's kingdom and need for repentance and the forgiveness of sins. The church holds, in accord with the Lutheran Confessions, that the Bible is the highest guide and authority for [[Christian]] faith, doctrine, and life. The norms in the congregation such as refraining from birth-control, make-up, and dancing, are some of the things members do not feel are right to do as a child of God.

The Laestadian Lutheran Church takes its name from [[Martin Luther]] and [[Lars Levi Laestadius]].  Laestadius was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor who served in northern Sweden from 1825 to 1861. The movement reached [[North America]] with [[Finland|Finnish]] immigrants in the 1860s. Congregations were first formally organized in [[Cokato, Minnesota]], in 1872 and [[Calumet, Michigan]], in 1873. The Laestadian movement in North America has suffered a number of [[schism]]s since 1890. The subjects of disagreement have mainly been the understanding of [[justification (theology)|justification]], God's congregation, and the [[sacrament]]s. The last division occurred in 1973 and resulted in the establishment of the Laestadian Lutheran Church.

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=mainline}}
The '''Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America'''  ({{lang-lv|Latviešu evangeliski luteriska Baznica Amerika}}; '''LELBA''') is a [[Lutheran]] denomination, formed in 1957 as a federation, and reorganized in 1975 as a formal denomination. In 1978 [[Lauma Lagzdins Zusevics]] was ordained as the first woman to serve as a full-time minister for the LELBA. In 2014 she became the first female Lutheran bishop in Latvian history, as the [[Church of Latvia]] proper does not currently recognize [[women's ordination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/religion/index.ssf/2015/04/clevelander_becomes_first_woma.html |title=Clevelander becomes first woman to lead Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church |publisher=cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, 12,000 congregants and 68 congregations of the church were present in the United States. It is headquartered in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].

'''Lutheran Church–Canada''' ('''LCC''') is a [[confessional Lutheran]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]] in [[Canada]]. It is the second largest [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] body in Canada after the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] (ELCIC). Together with the ELCIC and the [[Canadian Association of Lutheran Congregations]], it is one of only three all-Canadian Lutheran denominations. LCC was founded in 1988 when Canadian congregations of the [[St. Louis]]-based [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) formed an autonomous church body with a [[synod|synodical office]] in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutheranchurch-canada.ca/what.php|title=Lutheran Church–Canada &amp;nbsp;+++&amp;nbsp; What is Lutheran Church–Canada?|work=lutheranchurch-canada.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; LCC has no substantial theological divisions from LCMS and continues to have cooperative and sharing arrangements.

== History ==
Lutheranism in Canada dates back to Danish explorers in 1619 and German settlers in Nova Scotia in 1749, the latter encouraged to populate the territory by [[George II of Great Britain]]; a first church was raised in Halifax in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wlsessays.net/files/HeigesLutheranismCanada.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Canadian settlement spread west, Ontarian congregations followed in the late 1700s, Manitoban ones in the 1800s, and Albertan ones in the early 1900s. For two centuries Lutheran churches in Canada tended to be organized under shifting arrangements of sponsorship from various American synods and conferences until coalescing into LCMS in 1958 and ELCIC in 1967, and from 1958 to 1988 LCC existed as a federated group under the LCMS umbrella.&lt;ref name="walterfreitag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lutherans/|title=Lutherans|author=Walter Freitag|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following its independent establishment in January 1988, LCC created three [[district]]s: The Alberta-British Columbia (ABC) District, with offices in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]]; the Central District, in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]; and the East District, in [[Kitchener, Ontario]]. At present LCC has a congregational roster of 58 churches in British Columbia; 78 in Alberta; 62 in Saskatchewan; 20 in Manitoba; 124 in Ontario; 11 in Quebec; 2 in New Brunswick; and 2 in Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congregations|url=http://www.lutheranchurch.ca/congregations.php|publisher=Lutheran Church–Canada|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services are variously offered in [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], and [[Korean language|Korean]]. Sixteen Canadian congregations — one in [[Montreal]], and the rest in [[Ontario]] — remain affiliated with the LCMS in that body's [[SELC District (LCMS)|SELC District]].

== Doctrines ==
Like other [[Conservatism|conservative]] Lutheran bodies, LCC professes the Lutheran Confessions as contained in the [[Book of Concord]] (e.g. the theology of an inerrant Bible). LCC practices [[closed communion]], viewing [[Eucharist|communion]] as an intimate act shared only with other Christians who subscribe to LCC's doctrines. LCC practices [[infant baptism]] and normally requires [[confirmation]] instruction for full congregational participation. The church body is in communion with some member synods of the [[International Lutheran Council]] (e.g. [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|LCMS]]). Many LCC congregations use the ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'' as their hymnal.

While LCC churches do not permit women in ministerial roles, women serve in elected or appointed lay offices in churches, such as teachers and [[deacon|deaconesses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutheranchurch.ca/theological.php?s=women|title=Lutheran Church–Canada &amp;nbsp;+++&amp;nbsp; Commission on Theology and Church Relations|work=lutheranchurch.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The church body has two seminaries established for the training of [[pastor]]s, [[Concordia Lutheran Theological Seminary]] in St. Catharines, Ontario (opened 1976), and [[Concordia Lutheran Seminary]] in Edmonton, Alberta (opened 1984).

[[Concordia University of Edmonton]] is an independent university in Edmonton established by the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] in 1921 to train Lutheran pastors. It became an auxiliary of LCC in 1988 and remained so until 2010. Concordia provided training programs for church workers until their suspension in 2015. Concordia as of November 2015 is no longer Lutheran in its outlook or affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutheranchurch.ca/canluth/cl3002-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-20th century, health care initiatives also grew with the establishment of auxiliary hospitals and senior citizens' homes under LCC auspices, as well as military and prison chaplaincies.&lt;ref name="walterfreitag"/&gt;

The official archive of Lutheran Church–Canada, the underlying districts, and auxiliaries was the Lutheran Historical Institute, Edmonton. It closed in August 2015 after Concordia University of Edmonton and the Alberta British Columbia District of the LCC refused to provide funding. This occurred due to administrative and financial irregularities within Lutheran entities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lccarchives.com/&lt;/ref&gt; 

LCC is involved with foreign missions in Nicaragua, where work begun in 1997, which resulted in the founding of the [[Lutheran Church Synod of Nicaragua]] ({{lang-es|Iglesia Luterana Sinodo de Nicaragua}}) in 2008; southeast Asia, where it assists in providing theological education for future pastors in Thailand and Cambodia; Venezuela; and Ukraine, where it partners with the Synod of Evangelical Lutheran Churches of Ukraine in the training of pastors at Concordia Seminary in Usatovo (near [[Odessa]]) in the southern part of the country.

The '''Lutheran Church - International''' (LC-I)&lt;ref&gt;North Dakota Secretary of State Nonprofit Corporation Articles of Amendment, 5-26-2011, ID # 3.938.900&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[Christian denomination]] established in 1967 and based in [[Lyons, New York]]. Its president from 1967 to 1998 was Pastor E. Edward Tornow of [[North Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries|work=Grand Forks Herald|agency=McClatchy - Tribune Business News|date=September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1967 to 2011 the LC-I was known as the '''International Lutheran Fellowship'''.&lt;ref&gt;North Dakota Secretary of State, Articles of Incorporation Certificate 3487NP issued 4-4-1967&lt;/ref&gt; The LC-I has a mixed episcopal/congregational structure, with four [[dioceses]] in [[North America]], including the Northeastern Diocese, the Mid-America Diocese, the Southern Diocese, and the Western Diocese.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution: Lutheran Church-International, Last Amended at the Mundelein Synod, July 29, 2011, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; A Missionary District for Latin and Caribbean ministries is based in Puerto Rico. The LC-I also has ministry outreach in India.  The current president of the LC-I is Robert W. Hotes.

The Lutheran Church-International describes itself as "Confessional", "Orthodox", "Ecumenical (within the understandings based on the Book of Concord)", and "Evangelical".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutheranchurchinternational.org&lt;/ref&gt; Confessionally, it adheres to the "Gospel of [[Jesus Christ]] as faithfully witnessed by the [[Augsburg Confession]] of 1530, and the [[Book of Concord]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutheranchurchinternational.org&lt;/ref&gt; As an orthodox [[Christian]] body, "the LC-I maintains a traditional, faithful understanding of [[Lutheranism]] within the church catholic".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutheranchurchinternational.org&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the LC-I has stated that it will "work with faithful Christians globally", and "internally with those church bodies with whom [[theological]] cooperation is possible".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutheranchurchinternational.org&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the LC-I sees itself as "a church of the [[Great Commission]]", seeking to "make disciples of all nations".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutheranchurchinternational.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lutheran World Parish is a unique ministry within the LC-I. A current LC-I brochure states that the Lutheran World Parish consists of "Individuals desiring to affiliate with the LC-I, but who are not near (a)...congregation".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lutheranchurchinternational.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2006, the Order of St. Francis-Lutheran (OSF-L) is another ministry of the Lutheran Church-International. The Order is based in [[St. Catharines]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] and is headed by Rev. Larry J. Goodnough. Rev. Goodnough was commissioned as the OSF-L Superior by Bishop Bougher of the LC-I Northeastern Diocese. Rev. William Babbitt of Florida serves as U.S. Superior. The OSF-L is a ministry of [[laity|lay persons]] and clergy in the spirit of [[Francis of Assisi]], not a [[religious order]].

==History==
===Origins===
The Missouri Synod emerged from several communities of German Lutheran immigrants during the 1830s and 1840s. In [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], and [[Michigan]], isolated Germans in the dense forests of the American frontier were brought together and ministered to by missionary [[F. C. D. Wyneken]]. A movement of Confessional Lutherans under [[Martin Stephan]] created a community in [[Perry County, Missouri]], and [[St. Louis]], Missouri. In Michigan and Ohio, missionaries sent by [[Wilhelm Löhe]] ministered to scattered congregations and founded German Lutheran communities in [[Frankenmuth, Michigan]], and the Saginaw Valley of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Lueker|first=Erwin L. |editor1-last=Bodensieck|editor1-first=Julius |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of the Lutheran Church |title=Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod|date=1965 |publisher=Augsburg Publishing House|volume=2 |pages=1408–1409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Saxon immigration====
{{main article|Saxon Lutheran immigration of 1838–39}}
In the 19th-century German [[Kingdom of Saxony]], Lutheran pastor Martin Stephan and many of his followers found themselves increasingly at odds with the [[rationalism]], [[Christian ecumenism]], and the prospect of a forced unionism of the Lutheran church with the [[Reformed]] church. In the neighboring [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Prussian Union of 1817]] put in place what they considered non-Lutheran [[Eucharist|communion]] and [[baptism]]al doctrine and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Baepler, Walter A., ''A Century of Grace: A History of the Missouri Synod, 1847–1947'' (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1947), 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to freely practice their [[Christianity|Christian]] faith in accordance with the Lutheran confessions outlined in the [[Book of Concord]], Stephan and between 600 and 700 other Saxon Lutherans left for the United States in November 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, Walter O., ''Zion on the Mississippi'' (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1953), 199f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their ships arrived between December 31, 1838, and January 20, 1839, in [[New Orleans]], with one ship lost at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Baepler, 28; Forster, 202-217.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the remaining immigrants left almost immediately, with the first group arriving in [[St. Louis]] on January 19, 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The final group, led by Stephan, remained in New Orleans for ten days, possibly to wait for the passengers of the lost ship ''Amalia''.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, 218.&lt;/ref&gt; The immigrants ultimately settled in [[Perry County, Missouri]], and in and around [[St. Louis]]. Stephan was initially the [[bishop]] of the new settlement, but he soon became embroiled in charges of corruption and sexual misconduct with members of the congregation and was expelled from the settlement, leaving [[C. F. W. Walther]] as the leader of the colony.&lt;ref&gt;Lueker, 1408&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, there was considerable debate within the settlement over the proper status of the church in the [[New World]]: whether it was a new church or whether it remained within the Lutheran hierarchy in Germany. Walther's view that they could consider themselves a new church prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Baepler, 46ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Löhe missionaries====
{{further information|Frankenmuth, Michigan#History}}
Beginning in 1841, the parish pastor in [[Neuendettelsau]], Bavaria—[[Johann Konrad Wilhelm Löhe|Wilhelm Löhe]]—inspired by appeals for aid to the German immigrants in North America, began to solicit funds for missionary work among them. He also began training men to become pastors and teachers, sending his first two students—Adam Ernst and Georg Burger—to America on August 5, 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Graebner, Theodore, "The Loehe Foundations"
 in H. W. T. Dau, ed., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fIgSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR1 Ebenezer: Reviews of the Work of the Missouri Synod during Three Quarters of a Century]'' (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1922), 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Löhe ultimately sent over 80 pastors and students of theology to America; these pastors founded and served congregations throughout Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Pless, John T., [http://www.ctsfw.net/media/pdfs/PlessLoeheMissouriSynod.pdf "Wilhelm Loehe and the Missouri Synod: Forgotten Paternity or Living Legacy?"] (paper presented to the International Loehe Society assembled at Wartburg Theological Seminary, July 12. 2005), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Löhe also led an early and largely abortive effort to send missionaries to convert the Native Americans. In 1844 and 1845, he solicited colonists to form a German Lutheran settlement in Michigan, with the thought that this settlement would also serve as the base for missionary activity among the Native Americans. The colonists left Germany on April 20, 1845, under the leadership of Pastor August Crämer, and arrived in [[Saginaw County, Michigan]], in August of that year. They founded several villages—[[Frankenmuth, Michigan|Frankenmuth]], [[Frankenlust Township, Michigan|Frankenlust]], [[Blumfield Township, Michigan|Frankentrost]], and Frankenhilf (now known as [[Denmark Township, Michigan|Richville]])—and worked to convert the Native Americans. They had limited success, however, and the villages became nearly exclusively German settlements within a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Graebner, 87–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.frankenmuth.org/about-frankenmuth/history|title=Michigan's Little Bavaria|access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to sending pastors, theological students, and colonists to America, Löhe also played an instrumental role in the formation of [[Concordia Theological Seminary]], raising funds for the new institution and sending eleven theological students and a professor from Germany to help found it. The seminary's first president, [[Wilhelm Sihler]], had also been sent by Löhe to America several years before.

It was due to Löhe's great zeal and indefatigable labors that the LCMS' first president, C. F. W. Walther, once said of him, "Next to God, it is Pastor Loehe to whom our Synod is indebted for its happy beginning and rapid growth in which it rejoices; it may well honor him as its spiritual father. It would fill the pages of an entire book to recount even briefly what for many years this man, with tireless zeal in the noblest unselfish spirit, has done for our Lutheran Church and our Synod in particular."&lt;ref&gt;Erich H. Heintzen, ''Love Leaves Home: Wilhelm Loehe and the Missouri Synod'' (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1973), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding and early years===
[[File:StPaulsMissouriSynod.JPG|thumb|100px|left|St. Paul's in Chicago, where the first meeting of the Missouri Synod was held.&lt;ref&gt;Mezger, George. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=w4cSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA44 Denkstein zum fünfundsiebzigjährigen Jubiläum der Missourisynode, 1847–1922]''. Concordia. St. Louis: 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Friedrich August Brünn.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Old Lutherans|Old Lutheran]] free church leader [[Friedrich August Brünn]] sent about 235 men to serve as pastors in the Missouri Synod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=b&amp;word=BRUNN.FRIEDRICHAUGUST|title=Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod - Christian Cyclopedia|at=Brunn, Friedrich August}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1844 and 1845, the three groups listed above (the Saxons, the Löhe men, and Wyneken and one of his assistants) began to discuss the possibility of forming a new, [[Confessional Lutheranism|confessional Lutheran]] church body. As a result of these discussions, the Löhe missionaries and Wyneken and his assistant (F. W. Husmann) decided to leave their respective synods. Two planning meetings were held in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] in May and July of 1846.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Polack, ''Fathers and Founders'' (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1938), 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on April 26, 1847, twelve pastors representing fourteen German Lutheran congregations met in Chicago, Illinois, and officially founded the new church body, the ''German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio and Other States''. Walther became the fledgling denomination's first president.&lt;ref&gt;Baepler, 98f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The synod was quickly noted for its conservatism and self-professed orthodoxy. The synod's constitution required all members (both pastors and congregations) to pledge fealty to the entire [[Book of Concord]], to reject unionism and [[syncretism]] of every kind, to use only doctrinally pure books in both church and school, and to provide for the Christian education of their children.&lt;ref&gt;Polack, 72f.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, these requirements meant that altar and pulpit fellowship was usually restricted to those Lutheran congregations and synods who were in complete doctrinal agreement with the Missouri Synod.&lt;ref&gt;Baepler, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The LCMS' conservatism soon drew it into conflict with other Lutheran synods, the majority of which were then experimenting with so-called "[[Samuel Simon Schmucker|American Lutheranism]]." In addition, the LCMS also quickly became embroiled in a dispute with the [[Lutheran Synod of Buffalo|Buffalo Synod]] and its leader, [[Johannes Andreas August Grabau]], over the proper understanding of the Church and the [[Minister (Christianity)|Ministry]]. Within a few years, this conflict led to a separation between the Missouri Synod and Löhe, as Löhe's views were close to those of Grabau.&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Steffens, "The Doctrine of the Church and the Ministry" in H. W. T. Dau, ed., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fIgSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR1 Ebenezer: Reviews of the Work of the Missouri Synod during Three Quarters of a Century]'' (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1922), ''150ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these conflicts, the Missouri Synod experienced fairly rapid growth in its early years, leading to the subdivision of the synod into four [[Districts of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|districts]] in 1854. This growth was due largely to the synod's efforts, under the leadership of its second president, [[F. C. D. Wyneken]], to care for German immigrants, help them find a home among other Germans, build churches and [[parochial school]]s, and train pastors and teachers. The synod continued these outreach efforts throughout the 19th century, becoming the largest Lutheran church body in the United States by 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Sheeleigh, ed., ''[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah3kaa;view=1up;seq=488 The Lutheran Almanac and Year-Book for the Year of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ 1889]'' (Philadelphia: Lutheran Publication Society, 1889), 20–21. Note that this is the first year the LCMS was larger than all of the constituent synods of the General Council combined. If comparing the LCMS to individual synods within the General Synod or General Council, it had been the largest American Lutheran synod since around the year 1870.&lt;/ref&gt; By the synod's fiftieth anniversary in 1897, it had grown to  687,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Baepler, 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Synodical Conference===
{{main article|Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America}}
Between 1856 and 1859, the Missouri Synod hosted a series of four free conferences in order to explore the possibility of entering into fellowship agreements with other conservative Lutheran synods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=f&amp;word=FREELUTHERANCONFERENCES|title=Free Lutheran Conferences|year=2000|editor-last=Lueker|editor-first=Erwin L.|editor2-last=Poellot|editor2-first=Luther|editor3-last=Jackson|editor3-first=Paul|website=Christian Cyclopedia|publisher=Concordia Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these conferences, the LCMS entered into fellowship with the [[Synod of the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Norwegian Synod]] in 1857. In 1872, these two synods joined the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|Wisconsin]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio|Ohio]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Minnesota|Minnesota]], and [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Illinois|Illinois]] Synods, other conservative Lutheran bodies, in forming the [[Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Baepler, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, the constituent synods of the Synodical Conference considered a plan to reorganize into a single unified church body with a single seminary. Some preliminary moves were made in this direction (including the 1880 absorption of the Illinois Synod into the LCMS' Illinois District), but opposition from some synods postponed the complete implementation of this plan, and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America#Predestinarian Controversy|Predestinarian Controversy]] of the 1880s scuttled the plan entirely. As a result of the controversy, several pastors and congregations withdrew from the Ohio Synod to form the Concordia Synod; this synod merged with the LCMS in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=S&amp;word=SYNODICALCONFERENCE|title=Synodical Conference|year=2000|editor-last=Lueker|editor-first=Erwin L.|editor2-last=Poellot|editor2-first=Luther|editor3-last=Jackson|editor3-first=Paul|website=Christian Cyclopedia|publisher=Concordia Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English transition===
{{further information|English District (LCMS)}}
For the first thirty years of its existence, the Missouri Synod focused almost exclusively on meeting the spiritual needs of German-speaking Lutherans, leaving work among English-speaking Lutherans to other synods, particularly the [[Evangelical Lutheran Tennessee Synod|Tennessee]] and Ohio Synods. In 1872, members of the Tennessee Synod invited representatives from the Missouri, [[Evangelical Lutheran Holston Synod|Holston]], and Norwegian Synods to discuss the promotion of English work among the more "Americanized" Lutherans, resulting in the organization of the "English Evangelical Lutheran Conference of Missouri." This conference was reorganized in 1888 as an independent church body: "The English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri and Other States," which then merged into the LCMS as the "English District" in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=m&amp;word=MISSOURIANDOTHERSTATES.THEENGLISHEVANGELICALLUTHERANSYNODOF|title=Missouri and Other States, The English Evangelical Lutheran Synod of|year=2000|editor-last=Lueker|editor-first=Erwin L.|editor2-last=Poellot|editor2-first=Luther|editor3-last=Jackson|editor3-first=Paul|website=Christian Cyclopedia|publisher=Concordia Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englishdistrict.org/about-us/our-history|title=Our History|website=The English District of the LCMS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first twenty years, the English Synod founded two colleges, organized dozens of congregations and parochial schools, took over the publication of the "Lutheran Witness" (the LCMS' English-language newspaper), and published several hymnals and other books.

English work became more widespread in the LCMS during the first two decades of the twentieth century, with older members of the Synod continuing to speak primarily [[German language|German]] and younger members increasingly switching to [[English language|English]]. As one scholar has explained, "The overwhelming evidence from internal documents of these [Missouri Synod] churches, and particularly their schools&amp;nbsp;... indicates that the German-American school was a bilingual one much (perhaps a whole generation or more) earlier than 1917, and that the majority of the pupils may have been English-dominant bilinguals from the early 1880s on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/gachurch/biggac.html|first=Harold|last=Schiffman|title=Language loyalty in the German-American Church: the Case of an Over-confident Minority|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-German sentiment during the wars hastened the "Americanization" of the church and caused many churches to add English services and in some cases, drop German services entirely. During the years of language transition, the Synod's membership continued to grow, until by 1947, the Synod had grown to over 1.5 million members.&lt;ref&gt;Baepler, 355.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FranzPieper.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Franz Pieper]], June 27, 1852 – June 3, 1931]]

During this time, the LCMS expanded its missionary efforts through the creation of its own radio station—[[KFUO (AM)]] (1923)—and its own international radio program—''[[The Lutheran Hour]]'' (1930). Several years later, the synod began broadcasting its own TV drama—''[[This Is the Life (TV series)|This Is the Life]]'' (1952).

===Post-WWII===
{{ref improve|section|date=June 2018}}
In 1947, the church body shortened its name from "The Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and other States" to its present one, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. On January 1, 1964, the [[National Evangelical Lutheran Church]], an historically [[Finnish-American]] Lutheran church, merged with the LCMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=f&amp;word=FINNISHLUTHERANSINAMERICA|title=Finnish Lutherans in America|year=2000|editor-last=Lueker|editor-first=Erwin L.|editor2-last=Poellot|editor2-first=Luther|editor3-last=Jackson|editor3-first=Paul|website=Christian Cyclopedia|publisher=Concordia Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, the [[Synod of Evangelical Lutheran Churches]], an historically [[Slovak American|Slovak-American]] church, also merged with the LCMS, forming the [[SELC District (LCMS)|SELC District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.selc.lcms.org/aboutus.htm |title=About Us |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=SELC District of the LCMS |access-date=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1950s, the LCMS became somewhat friendlier to the more liberal Lutheran bodies, despite the opposition of the other members of the Synodical Conference. This culminated in the break up of the Synodical Conference in 1963. Six years later, the LCMS formed the [[Lutheran Council in the United States of America]] (LCUSA) with several moderate-to-liberal Lutheran bodies.

However, with the election of [[J. A. O. Preus II]] as its president in 1969, the LCMS began a sharp turn towards a more conservative direction. A dispute over the use of the [[Historical criticism|historical-critical method]] for Biblical interpretation led to the suspension of [[John Tietjen]] as president of [[Concordia Seminary]]; in response many of the faculty and students left the seminary and formed [[Seminex]] (Concordia Seminary in Exile), which took up residence at the nearby [[Eden Theological Seminary]] in suburban St. Louis. In 1976 about 250 of the congregations supporting Seminex left the Synod to form the [[Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches]], which became part of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] in 1988. The LCMS pulled out of LCUSA shortly after the AELC schism, only a few years after the organization's formation. The entire controversy marked an instance of a conservative religious body resisting theological change rather than incorporating its tenets, something relatively rare among American religious bodies,{{Citation needed|reason=The rarity of such resistance is not self-evident; a citation would be helpful.|date=October 2017}} with the only other analogous scenario being the fundamentalist resurgence in the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] from the late 1970s to the early 1990s.

==Foreign missions==

In 1900 the LCMS began sending missionaries to Brazil to minister to German-speaking immigrants in that country, and in 1904 created the Brazil District for the administration of the resulting congregations. Work was begun in Argentina in 1905 as part of the Brazil District. A separate Argentina District was established in 1926/1927. Both districts became independent church bodies that retain close relationships with the LCMS: the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Brazil]] in 1980, and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Argentina]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| editor1-first=Erwin L. |editor1-last=Lueker |editor2-first=Luther |editor2-last=Poellot |editor3-first=Paul |editor3-last=Jackson |encyclopedia=Christian Cyclopedia |article=Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod, Districts of The|accessdate=May 16, 2018 |edition=Online |year=2000 |publisher=[[Concordia Publishing House]] |location=St. Louis |url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=l&amp;word=LUTHERANCHURCH-MISSOURISYNOD.DISTRICTSOFTHE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LCMS oversaw an extensive roster of congregations in [[Canada]] until 1988, when the Canadian component became a separate and autonomous organization, [[Lutheran Church-Canada]]. However, this was an administrative and not theological division and the two groups still share close ties. A small number of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] churches remain within the LCMS.

==Beliefs==

===Doctrinal sources===
One of the signature teachings of the [[Protestant Reformation|Lutheran Reformation]] is ''[[Sola scriptura]]''—"Scripture alone." The Missouri Synod believes that the [[Bible]] is the only standard by which church teachings can be judged, and holds that Scripture is best explained and interpreted by the [[Book of Concord]]—a series of confessions of faith composed by Lutherans in the 16th century. Missouri Synod pastors and congregations agree to teach in harmony with the Book of Concord ''[[Confessional Lutheranism#"Quia" versus "Quatenus" subscription|because]]'' it teaches and faithfully explains the Word of God, not based on its own authority alone. Since the Missouri Synod is a confessional church body, its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are sworn by their oaths of ordination or installation, or both, to interpret the Sacred Scriptures according to the Book of Concord.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, 2010 edition, Article II Confession,  p. 13, and Article V Membership, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Its ordained and commissioned ministers of religion are asked to honor and uphold other official teachings of the Synod, meaning "to abide by, act, and teach in accordance with," but are not sworn to believe, confess and teach them as correct interpretations of the Sacred Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;The Bylaws of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, 2010 edition, Doctrinal Resolutions and Statements, 1.6.2. (7), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Missouri Synod also teaches [[biblical inerrancy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=563 Of the Holy Scriptures], Missouri Synod&lt;/ref&gt; the teaching that Bible is inspired by God and is without error. For this reason, they reject much—if not all—of modern [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] scholarship. [[Franz August Otto Pieper]]'s [http://www.lcms.org/doctrine/doctrinalposition Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod] provides a summary of the major beliefs of the LCMS.

====Salvation====
The Missouri Synod believes that [[justification (theology)|justification]] comes from God "by [[divine grace]] alone, through faith alone, on account of Christ alone." It teaches that [[Jesus]] is the focus of the entire Bible and that [[faith]] in him alone is the way to eternal [[salvation]]. The synod rejects any attempt to attribute salvation to anything other than Christ's [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|death and resurrection]].

====Means of grace====
The synod teaches that the Word of God, both written and preached, and the [[Sacrament]]s are [[means of grace]] through which the [[Holy Spirit]] gives the gift of God's grace, creates faith in the hearts of individuals, forgives sins for the sake of Christ's death on the [[Christian cross|cross]], and grants eternal life and salvation. Many Missouri Synod Lutherans define a sacrament as an action instituted by Jesus that combines a promise in God's Word with a physical element, although the synod holds no official definition for sacrament. This means that some may disagree on the number of sacraments. All agree that [[Baptism]] and [[Eucharist|Communion]] are sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=572 Of the means of grace], Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod&lt;/ref&gt; [[Confession (religion)#Confession of sins|Confession and absolution]] is called a sacrament in the [[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]] and so is also considered by many Lutherans to be a sacrament, because it was instituted by Christ and has His promise of grace, even though it is not tied to a physical element.

Unlike [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], Lutherans agree that the means of grace are [[Irresistible grace#Lutheran|resistible]]; this belief is based on numerous biblical references as discussed in the ''Book of Concord''.

====Sacramental Union and the Eucharist====
Regarding the [[Eucharist]], the LCMS rejects both the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] doctrine of [[transubstantiation]] and the [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] teaching that the true body and blood of Christ are not consumed with the consecrated bread and wine in the Eucharist. Rather, it believes in the doctrine of the [[sacramental union]], [[Real Presence]], that the Body and Blood of Christ are truly present "in, with, and under" the elements of bread and wine. Or, as the [[Smalcald Articles]] express this mystery: "Of the Sacrament of the Altar, we hold that the bread and wine in the Supper are Christ's true body and blood."&lt;ref&gt;Smalcald Articles, Concordia: The Lutheran Confessions (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 2005), 305.&lt;/ref&gt; It is occasionally reported that the LCMS and other Lutherans teach the doctrine of [[consubstantiation]]. Consubstantiation is generally rejected by Lutherans and is explicitly rejected by the LCMS as an attempt to define the holy mystery of Christ's presence.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Pieper, Christian Dogmatics (St. Louis:Concordia Publishing House, 1953), 3:326–27 and John Theodore Mueller, Christian Dogmatics (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1934), 519–20, 528.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eschatology====
The Missouri Synod flatly rejects [[millennialism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=578 Of the Millennium], Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod&lt;/ref&gt; and considers itself [[Amillennialism|amillennialist.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&amp;id=417 End Times – The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that they believe there will be no literal 1000-year visible earthly kingdom of Jesus, a view termed as "realized millennialism" in which the "thousand years" of Rev 20:1–10 is taken figuratively as a reference to the time of Christ's reign as king from the day of his ascension. Hence, the millennium is a present reality (Christ's heavenly reign), not a future hope for a rule of Christ on earth after his return (the [[parousia]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=p&amp;word=PAROUSIA%7c&amp;#91;Christian|title=Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod - Christian Cyclopedia|at=Parousia}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. Mt 13:41–42; Mt 28:18; Eph 2:6; Col 3:1–3).

====Law and Gospel====
The LCMS believes that the Holy Scriptures contain two crucial teachings—[[Law and Gospel|the Law and the Gospel]]. The Law is all those demands in the Bible which must be obeyed in order to gain salvation. However, because all people are [[sin#Christianity|sinners]], it is impossible for people to completely obey the Law. Therefore, the Law implies an inevitable consequence of God's wrath, judgment, and damnation. The Gospel, on the other hand, is the promise of free salvation from God to sinners. The Law condemns; the Gospel saves. Both the Law and the Gospel are gifts from God; both are necessary. The function of the law is to show people their sinful nature and drive them to the Gospel, in which the forgiveness of sin is promised for the sake of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nafzger|first1=Samuel H.|title=An Introduction to the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|url=http://www.lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&amp;id=961|website=www.lcms.org|publisher=Concordia Publishing House|accessdate=September 22, 2014|page=12|format=PDF|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=Matthew|title=Back to Basics: Law and Gospel|journal=The Lutheran Witness|date=May 2014|volume=133|issue=5|page=1|url=http://blogs.lcms.org/2014/back-to-basics-law-and-gospel|accessdate=September 22, 2014|publisher=Concordia Publishing House|issn=0024-757X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LCMS holds that the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] both contain both [[Law and Gospel]]. The Old Testament, therefore, is valuable to Christians. Its teachings point forward in time to the Cross of Christ in the same way that the New Testament points backward in time to the Cross. This Lutheran doctrine was summarized by C. F. W. Walther in ''The Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel''.

===Other doctrine===

====Antichrists====
The LCMS holds that all "false teachers who teach contrary to Christ's Word are opponents of Christ" and, insofar as they do so, are anti-Christ.&lt;ref name="FAQs"&gt;[http://www.lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&amp;id=552 LCMS Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt; The LCMS does not teach, nor has it ever taught, that any individual pope as a person is to be identified with the Antichrist.&lt;ref name="FAQs" /&gt; However, to the extent that the papacy continues to claim as official dogma the canons and decrees of the [[Council of Trent]], the LCMS position is that the office of the papacy is the Antichrist.&lt;ref name="FAQs" /&gt;

====Creationism====
The LCMS officially supports literal [[creationism]] but does not have an official position on the precise age of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&amp;id=1103 Creation and Evolution], Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, by Dr. A.L. Barry.&lt;/ref&gt; An official publication of the synod, the well known "Brief Statement of 1932," states under the heading "Of Creation": "We teach that God has created heaven and earth, and that in the manner and in the space of time recorded in the Holy Scriptures, especially Gen. 1 and 2, namely, by His almighty creative word, and in six days."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcms.org/doctrine/doctrinalposition Of Creation], A Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod, Adopted 1932.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the recent 2004 LCMS synodical resolution 2-08A "To commend preaching and teaching Creation," all LCMS churches and educational institutions—including preschool through 12th grade, universities, and seminaries—are "to teach creation from the Biblical perspective." The LCMS website states that an individual's personal views regarding creation do not disqualify a person from being a member of the LCMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LCMS Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.lcms.org/faqs/thebible#created}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Freemasonry====
The Missouri Synod is opposed to [[Freemasonry]] and instructs its pastors and laypeople to avoid membership or participation in it because the teachings of Freemasonry are in direct conflict with the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcms.org/faqs/lcmsviews#masons|title=LCMS Views - Frequently Asked Questions - The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod|website=www.lcms.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baptism and other doctrine===
The LCMS practices infant baptism, based on Acts 2:38–39&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Acts|2:38–39|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other passages of Scripture. It also subscribes to the statement of faith found in the Apostles' Creed, the Ten Commandments and the Lord's Prayer to be applicable to daily life. These doctrines are emphasized in ''[[Luther's Small Catechism]]''.

==Practices==

===Worship and music===
The Missouri Synod's original constitution stated that one of its purposes is to strive toward uniformity in practice, while more recent changes to those documents also encourage responsible and doctrinally sound diversity. The synod requires that [[hymn]]s, songs, [[liturgy|liturgies]], and practices be in harmony with the [[Bible]] and [[Book of Concord]]. Worship in Missouri Synod congregations is generally thought of as orthodox and liturgical, utilizing a printed order of service and hymnal, and is typically accompanied by a [[pipe organ]] or [[piano]]. The contents of LCMS hymnals from the past, such as ''[[The Lutheran Hymnal]]'' and ''[[Lutheran Worship]]'', and those of its newest hymnal, ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'', highlight the synod's unwavering stance towards more traditional styles of hymnody and liturgy. More traditional LCMS Lutherans point to the Lutheran Confessions in their defense of liturgical worship.&lt;ref name=examples&gt;"Since, therefore, the Mass among us is supported by the example of the church as seen from the Scriptures and the Fathers, we are confident that it cannot be disapproved, especially since the customary public ceremonies are for the most part retained." (Augsburg Confession XXIV:40) Also, "We on our part also retain many ceremonies and traditions (such as the liturgy of the Mass and various canticles, festivals, and the like) which serve to preserve order in the church." (Augburg Confession Article XXVI:40) And, "We gladly keep the old traditions set up in the church because they are useful and promote tranquility...Our enemies falsely accuse us of abolishing good ordinances and church discipline...the public liturgy is more decent than in theirs." (Apology to the Augsburg Confession, Article XV:38–39) And, "...we do not abolish the Mass but religiously keep and defend it." (Apology to the Augsburg Confession Article XXIV:1)And, "We on our part also retain many ceremonies and traditions (such as the liturgy of the Mass and various canticles, festivals, and the like) which serve to preserve order in the church." (Augburg Confession, Article XXVI:40)&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the later parts of the twentieth century and up until present day, many congregations have adopted a more progressive style of worship, employing different styles such as [[contemporary Christian music]] with guitars and praise bands and often project song lyrics onto screens instead of using hymnals. While this shift in style challenges the traditionalism of hymnody that the LCMS holds strongly, the LCMS has released a statement on worship admitting that, "The best of musical traditions, both ancient and modern, are embraced by the Lutheran church in its worship, with an emphasis on congregational singing, reinforced by the choir."&lt;ref&gt;http://lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&amp;id=1090&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception of communion===
The LCMS endorses the doctrine of close or [[closed communion]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Cyclopedia]] s.v. "[http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=C&amp;word=CLOSECOMMUNION Close Communion]." (St. Louis:Concordia Publishing House; Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, 2000, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcms.org/graphics/assets/media/LCMS/wa_fellowship-lordssupper.pdf Fellowship in the Lord's Supper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326221334/http://www.lcms.org/graphics/assets/media/LCMS/wa_fellowship-lordssupper.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}, LCMS&lt;/ref&gt;—the policy of sharing the [[Eucharist]] ordinarily only with those who are [[Baptism|baptized]] and [[Confirmation|confirmed]] members of one of the congregations of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod or of a congregation of one of its [[Sister Churches (ecclesiology)|sister churches]] with which it has formally declared altar and pulpit fellowship (i.e., agreement in all articles of doctrine). Missouri Synod congregations implement closed communion in various ways, requiring conformity to official doctrine in various degrees. Usually, visitors are asked to speak with the pastor before coming to that congregation's altar for the first time. Most congregations invite those uneducated on the subject of the Eucharist to join in the fellowship and receive a blessing instead of the body and blood of Christ. Some congregations, however, do not implement the synod's policy, celebrating open communion and welcoming all to their altars.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Ordination===
Ordination is seen as a public ceremony of recognition that a man has received and accepted a divine call, and hence is considered to be in the office of the public ministry. The [[Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope]] agrees that "ordination was nothing else than such a ratification" of local elections by the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.com/treatise.php#para70|title=Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope - Book of Concord|at=paragraph 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LCMS does not believe ordination is divinely instituted&lt;ref&gt;Adopted at Synod Convention, 1849 1, 97 Ordination, though an accepted, praiseworthy ceremony, has no command of God. [http://www.ctsfw.edu/bsmith-cts/etext/lcms/Synod/resolutions.pdf Official Missouri Synod Doctrinal Statements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225041133/http://www.ctsfw.edu/bsmith-cts/etext/lcms/Synod/resolutions.pdf |date=2009-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or an extension of an episcopal form of [[apostolic succession]] but sees the office grounded in the Word and Sacrament ministry of the Gospel, arguing that Scripture makes no distinction between a presbyter (priest) and a bishop (see [[Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope]], paragraphs 63,64, citing St. [[Jerome]]). The [[Augsburg Confession]] (Article XIV) holds that no one is to preach, teach, or administer the sacraments without a regular call.

LCMS pastors are generally required to have a four-year bachelor's degree (in any discipline), as well as a four-year [[Master of Divinity]] degree, which is usually obtained from one of these institutions: [[Concordia Seminary]] in St. Louis or the [[Concordia Theological Seminary]] in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] or at the two seminaries run by the [[Lutheran Church–Canada]]. Candidates may earn their Master of Divinity degree at other seminaries but may then be required to take colloquy classes at either St. Louis or Ft. Wayne. Seminary training includes classwork in historical theology, Biblical languages ([[Greek language#Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]), practical application (education, preaching, and mission), and doctrine (the basic teachings and beliefs of the synod).

===Role of women in the church===
The Missouri Synod teaches that the [[ordination of women]] as clergy is contrary to scripture. The issue of women's roles in the church body has continued to be a subject of debate within the synod. During the Cooperative Clergy Study Project in the year 2000, 10% out of 652 LCMS pastors surveyed stated that all clergy positions should be open to women, while 82% disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/COOPCLER.asp|title=Summary - The Cooperative Clergy Study Project - Data Archive - The Association of Religion Data Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congregations were permitted to enact female suffrage within Missouri Synod congregations in 1969, and it was affirmed at the Synod's 2004 convention that women may also "serve in humanly established offices" as long as those offices do not include any of the "distinctive functions of the pastoral office." Thus in many congregations of the LCMS, women now serve as congregation president or chairperson, etc. This is the cause of contention within the LCMS, with some congregations utilizing women in public worship to read lessons and assist in the distribution of holy communion. Other traditional Lutherans reject such practices as unbiblical, with a minority of congregations continuing the historic practice of [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod#Differences from LCMS (Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod)|male suffrage, similar to the Wisconsin Synod]].

===LCMS National Youth Gathering===
The National Youth Gathering is held every three years. The most recent gathering took place from July 16–20, 2016, in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. The theme for the 2016 gathering was "In Christ Alone." The previous gathering took place in 2013 in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]] from July 1–5, 2013. It was based on the theme, "Live Love(d)." The 2010 gathering in New Orleans was based on the theme "We Believe". In both 2007 and 2004, The LCMS National Youth Gatherings were held at the [[Orange County Convention Center]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. The gathering's theme in 2007 was "Chosen." The gathering in 2007 was originally planned to be held in New Orleans, Louisiana, but due to [[Hurricane Katrina]], the location was changed to Orlando, Florida. Around 25,000 youth attend each gathering. Many Christian bands and artists perform at gatherings. The next youth gathering is set to take place in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]], in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lcmsgathering.com/|title=Home|work=2019 LCMS Youth Gathering|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church structure==
The LCMS has a modified form of [[congregationalist polity|congregational]] polity. This is different from some other Lutheran bodies which have maintained [[episcopal polity]]; however, this is not considered to be a point of doctrine, as the Synod is in fellowship with some Lutheran church bodies in Europe that have an episcopal structure.

The corporate LCMS is formally constituted of two types of members: self-governing&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&amp;id=4507 Constitution of the Lutheran Church--Missouri Synod, Article VII.1]&lt;/ref&gt; local congregations that qualify for membership by mutual agreement to adhere to stated principles, and clergymen who qualify by similar means. Congregations hold legal title to their church buildings and other property, and call (hire) and dismiss their own clergy. Much of the practical work of the LCMS structure is as a free employment brokerage to bring the two together; it also allows the congregations to work together on projects far too large for even a local consortium of congregations to accomplish, such as foreign mission work.

[[File:LCMS corporate seal.jpg|thumb|left|Official seal of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]]

===Synod===
The LCMS as a whole is led by an ordained Synodical President, currently [[Matthew C. Harrison]]. The President is chosen at a synodical convention, a gathering of the two membership groups (professional clergymen and [[Laity|lay representatives]] from the member congregations). The convention is held every three years; discussions of doctrine and policy take place at these events, and elections are held to fill various Synod positions. The next Synod convention will be in 2019. Local conventions within each circuit and district are held in the intervening years.

===Districts===
{{main article|Districts of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod}}
The entire synod is divided into districts, usually corresponding to a specific geographic area, as well as two non-geographical districts, the [[English District (LCMS)|English]] and the [[SELC District (LCMS)|SELC]], which were formed when the formerly separate English Missouri Synod and the Slovak Synod, respectively, merged with the formerly German-speaking Missouri Synod. Each district is led by an elected district president, who must be an ordained clergyman. Most district presidencies are full-time positions, but there are a few exceptions in which the district president also serves as a parish pastor. The districts are subdivided into [[circuit (LCMS)|circuits]], each of which is led by a circuit visitor, who is an ordained pastor from one of the member congregations. Districts are roughly analogous to dioceses in other Christian communities.

===Congregations===
Congregations are served by full-time professional clergy. The LCMS is congregationalist with regard to polity.

==Organizations==
===Educational institutions===
In addition to its two seminaries, the LCMS operates nine universities, known as the [[Concordia University System]].

===Auxiliary organizations===
Among the LCMS's other auxiliary organizations are the Lutheran Laymen's League (now known as [[Lutheran Hour Ministries]]), which conducts outreach ministries including ''[[The Lutheran Hour]]'' radio program; and the [[Lutheran Women's Missionary League]]. The synod also operates [[Concordia Publishing House]], through which it publishes the official periodical of the LCMS, ''The Lutheran Witness''.

==Relationship with other Lutheran bodies==
Maintaining its position as a confessional church body emphasizing the importance of full agreement in the teachings of the Bible, the LCMS is not associated with ecumenical organizations such as the [[National Council of Churches]], the [[National Association of Evangelicals]], the [[World Council of Churches]] or the [[Lutheran World Federation]]. It is, however, a member of the [[International Lutheran Council]], made up of over 30 Lutheran churches worldwide that support the confessional doctrines of the Bible and [[the Book of Concord]]. At the 2007 convention, the delegates voted to establish altar and pulpit fellowship with the [[American Association of Lutheran Churches]] (AALC).

Although its strongly conservative views on theology and ethics might seem to make the LCMS politically compatible with Protestant [[evangelicalism|evangelicals]] and [[fundamentalism|fundamentalists]] in the U.S., the LCMS largely eschews political activity, partly out of concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the Lutheran distinction between the [[Doctrine of the two kingdoms|Two Kingdoms]] (see above), which repudiates the primarily [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] presuppositions about the totalizing rule of God that informs much, if not most, of U.S. evangelical understanding of politics and Christianity. However, both LCMS and Evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and should be protected by law since conception.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.lcms.org/graphics/assets/media/LCMS/wa_abortion.pdf http://www.lcms.org/graphics/assets/media/LCMS/wa_abortion.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The LCMS is distinguished from the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) by three main theological beliefs:
#The biblical understanding of fellowship: the LCMS believes in a distinction between the altar, pulpit fellowship, and other manifestations of Christian fellowship (i.e., a prayer fellowship). The WELS does not.
#The doctrine of the ministry: the LCMS believes that the Pastoral office is divinely established, but all other offices are human institutions and hence are not divinely established. The WELS believes that the Ministry of the Word is divinely established and that congregations and the synod may choose the forms of public ministry they wish to use.
#The role of women in the church: Although both the LCMS and WELS agree that Scripture reserves the pastoral office for men, the WELS also believes that Scripture forbids women's suffrage in the congregation.

==Membership and demographics==
Membership growth was substantial in the first half of the 20th century. According to the ''Yearbook of American &amp; Canadian Churches'',&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_887.asp| title = Historic Archive CD and ''Yearbook of American &amp; Canadian Churches''|publisher = The National Council of Churches|accessdate = 2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the LCMS had 628,695 members in 1925. By 1950 the number of members had grown to over 1.6 million. Membership peaked in 1970 at just under 2.8 million. In 2015 the LCMS reported 2,097,258 members and 6,105 churches, with 6,094 active clergy.&lt;ref name="LCMS Stats 2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=LCMS congregations report statistics for 2014|url=http://blogs.lcms.org/2015/statistics-for-2014|publisher=Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LCMS membership continues to be concentrated in the Upper Midwest. The five states with the highest rates of adherence are Nebraska, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Iowa.&lt;ref name="2000 Religious Congregations and Membership Study"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_887_d.asp| title = 2000 Religious Congregations and Membership Study|publisher = Glenmary Research Center|accessdate = 2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pew Research Center]]'s U.S. Religious Landscape Survey in 2014 found that the LCMS was the third-least racially diverse major religious group in the country. The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] was second and the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] was the least diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/27/the-most-and-least-racially-diverse-u-s-religious-groups/ | title = The most and least racially diverse U.S. religious groups | last = Lipka | first = Michael | date = July 27, 2015 | accessdate = July 27, 2015 | website = [[Pew Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 figures were:&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Religious Landscape Survey: Religious Beliefs and Practices, Diverse and Politically Relevant: Detailed Data Tables.

==In the news==
The LCMS bars its clergy from worshiping with other faiths, holding "that church fellowship or merger between church bodies in doctrinal disagreement with one another is not in keeping with what the Bible teaches about church fellowship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcms.org/page.aspx?pid=415|title=Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod|year=1932|publisher=Concordia Publishing House|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice of this, a Connecticut LCMS pastor was asked to apologize by the president of the denomination, and did so, for participating in an interfaith prayer vigil for the 26 children and adults [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|killed at a Newtown elementary school]], and an LCMS pastor in New York was suspended for praying at an interfaith vigil in 2001, 12 days after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shooting-newtown-idUSBRE91603F20130207|title=Pastor apologizes for role in prayer vigil after Connecticut massacre|publisher=Reuters|year=2013|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=synodical}}
The '''Lutheran Churches of the Reformation''' ('''LCR''') is an association of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] congregations. The LCR has its roots among groups of Lutherans that broke with the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) in the middle of the 20th century, and was formally incorporated in 1964. Church services are generally traditional and reverent in the style of the mid-1900s conservative Christians.

== Core Beliefs ==
The Lutheran Churches of the Reformation teach that the Bible is the only authoritative and error-free source for doctrine. It subscribes to the Lutheran Confessions (the [[Book of Concord]]) not in-so-far-as but because it is an accurate presentation of what Scripture teaches. It teaches that Jesus is the center of Scripture and the only way to eternal salvation, and that the Holy Spirit uses the gospel alone in Word and Sacraments (Baptism and Holy Communion) to bring people to faith in Jesus as Savior and keep them in that faith, strengthening them in their daily life of sanctification.

== Doctrine ==
The doctrine of the Lutheran Churches of the Reformation is summarized in [[Franz August Otto Pieper]]'s Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lcrusa.org/brief_statement.htm Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod&lt;/ref&gt; and Wallace H. McLaughlin's We All Believe in One True God: A Summary of Biblical Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orthodoxlutheran.org/pdf/We%20All%20Believe%20In%20One%20True%20God.pdf We All Believe in One True God: A Summary of Biblical Doctrine&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operations ==
The Lutheran Churches of the Reformation publishes ''One Accord'', a monthly devotional and news magazine, and ''The Faithful Word'', a quarterly theological journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcrusa.org/the-faithful-word.html|title=The Faithful Word|website=www.lcrusa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Martin Luther Institute of Sacred Studies in [[Decatur, Indiana]], is the seminary and teacher's college of the LCR.

The LCR is governed through annual conventions where delegates of the congregations vote. Doctrinal resolutions must be unanimous, or those in the minority will be suspended from the LCR. The day-to-day business of the LCR is run by the Council, whose members are elected to three year terms,&lt;ref name="lcrusa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcrusa.org/synopsis.htm|title=The Lutheran Churches of the Reformation: A Synopsis|website=Lutheran Churches of the Reformation|access-date=March 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010730080525/http://www.lcrusa.org/synopsis.htm|archive-date=July 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; commissions, and committees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lcrusa.org/commissions.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

For missions, the LCR has a missionary-at-large to serve those who have moved away from their congregations and other like-minded Lutherans. Abroad, the LCR supports congregations in Nigeria and Kenya and has trained pastors for the Lutheran Churches of the Reformation in Nigeria.&lt;ref name="lcrusa.org"/&gt; The LCR has also held seminars to train pastors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

As of March 2009, about 1,300 people are baptized members of ''LCR'' congregations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf LWF Statistics 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000000/http://www.lutheranworld.org/LWF_Documents/LWF-Statistics-2009.pdf |date=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to other Lutheran groups ==
The congregations in the LCR and the [[Concordia Lutheran Conference]] were organized as the Orthodox Lutheran Conference (OLC), in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordialutheranconf.com/clc/content/pekhistory.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt; The OLC split in 1956 after Prof. [[Paul E. Kretzmann]] suspended church-fellowship with some congregations after they charged him with teaching error in class. These congregations formed the [[Concordia Lutheran Conference]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concordialutheranconf.com/clc/content/ourdeclaration.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt; while the others, along with Kretzmann, joined with more conservatives leaving the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] to organize as the LCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/node/540|title=A Little Lecture on Little Little-Known Lutheran Synods - Essay File|date=7 July 2010|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707220127/http://www.wlsessays.net/node/540|archivedate=7 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LCR discussed church-fellowship with the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] in the 1960s, but declared that the differences regarding the doctrine of Church and Ministry were divisive of church-fellowship in July 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlsessays.net/node/539]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fellowship of Lutheran Congregations]] (FLC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concido.com/flc/|title=Fellowship of Lutheran Congregations|date=9 March 2002|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020309152052/http://www.concido.com/flc/|archivedate=9 March 2002|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of congregations that left the LCR in 1979 after a dispute concerning the proper procedure of excommunication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lutherantheology.com/excommunication.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The congregations of the FLC joined the [[Concordia Lutheran Conference]] circa 2004.

For a time in the 1990s, the LCR was in official church-fellowship with the [[Illinois Lutheran Conference]] (ILC). The ILC was organized in 1979 after three congregations left the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]in protest when a pastor was suspended because of claims he made regarding the [[King James Version of the Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illinoislutheranconference.org/a-brief-history-of-the-ilc.lwp/odyframe.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; There was controversy between the ILC and the LCR'regarding the "appearance of evil" ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205:22&amp;version=9 1 Thessalonians 5:22]) and the doctrine of Church and Ministry. The LCR severed the fellowship because of differences discovered during the controversy over the "appearance of evil".

In February 2006, five congregations and four pastors suspended church-fellowship with the rest of the LCR when, in the wake of a disagreement regarding the doctrine of the ministry, an LCR congregation was dissolved through legal action by certain members, most of whom were female, who disagreed with their pastor. This led to accusations of female [[suffrage]] by one side and legalism by the other. The LCR was never asked by both sides of the congregation to adjudicate the division. The congregations that suspended fellowship in February 2006 withdrew their membership from the LCR in April 2006 after a special convention called to address the controversy refused to discuss the matter of female suffrage and the aforementioned dissolution. A position paper titled ''The Ministry and Auxiliary Office with Respect to Legalism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lutherantheology.com/uploads/works/auxoffices/LCRAuxiliaryOffices.htm|title=The Ministry and Auxiliary Offices in respect to Legalism|website=lutherantheology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was presented at that conference in an attempt to resolve the controversy has since been adopted unanimously by the remaining congregations of the LCR. Another LCR position paper titled ''Liberty or Death''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxlutheran.org/pdf/Liberty%20or%20Death.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; written to draw attention to different kinds of legalism was subsequently adopted in July 2007. Those congregations that withdrew membership with the LCR have declared church-fellowship with each other&lt;ref&gt;[http://olcc.us/declaration.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; and have since organized the [[Orthodox Lutheran Confessional Conference]] (OLCC)&lt;ref&gt;[http://olcc.us/]&lt;/ref&gt;. A sixth congregation, in [[Hudson, Michigan]], later withdrew from the LCR over the same issues, and remains independent.

== Distinctive Characteristics ==
The LCR believes that the local congregation is the only divinely ordained church organization, and does not refer to synods or denominations as churches. This separates the group from some other conservative Lutherans such as the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuItem_itemID=7895&amp;cuTopic_topicID=14]&lt;/ref&gt;

The congregations of the LCR use the [[King James Version]] of the Bible for all public uses, the 1943 "Blue" edition of [[Luther's Small Catechism]] in confirmation instruction, and [[The Lutheran Hymnal]] of 1941.&lt;ref name="lcrusa.org"/&gt; The LCR does not, however, hold to the [[King James Only movement|King James Only]] position, since it recognizes the traditional Hebrew and Greek, for the Old and New Testaments respectively, to be authoritative over any translation.

In 1990, the LCR passed a resolution titled "Procreation" stating that birth control, in all forms, is sin, although the denomination "allow(s) for"..."exceptional cases (casuistry)", for example, when the woman's life or health is at risk.

Congregations of the LCR follow [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202:12&amp;version=9 1 Timothy 2:12] in practicing male-only suffrage in congregational voter's assemblies. This represents alignment with the most conservative Lutheran bodies in the U.S., and departs significantly from its parent body, the LCMS, which permits its congregations local discretion on the matter.

The Lutheran Churches of the Reformation,&lt;ref name="briefstatement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcrusa.org/brief_statement.htm|title=Brief Statement of the Doctrinal Position of the Missouri Synod|publisher=[[Concordia Publishing House]]|year=1932| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; hold to ''Brief Statement'' of 1932, which confirms the long-held traditional beliefs of the Lutheran Church as documented in the [http://bookofconcord.org/ Book of Concord], including: inerrency of Scripture, Divine creation in six days, a young earth, the divine institution of the local congregation, the divine institution of the local office of the ministry, closed fellowship, and of the antichrist.

'''Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ''' ('''LCMC''') is an association of [[Lutheran]] congregations in the [[United States]]. It describes itself as an affiliation of autonomous Lutheran churches and not a denomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oslcauduboniowa.org/from-the-pastor/sanctity-of-human-life/ Sanctity of Human Life]&lt;/ref&gt; It began in 2001 in response to some liberal views of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA). LCMC is characterized by the stances it takes on Lutheran [[polity]], [[biblical authority]], and [[human sexuality]]. The group describes itself as "centrist" or "mainstream", noting that it stands between the more liberal ELCA and the more conservative [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) and other [[Lutheran church bodies in North America]].

==History==
[[File:Lighthouse Lutheran Church in Freedom.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lighthouse Lutheran Church, a member congregation in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]]]]

LCMC was started by the [[WordAlone]] Network as an alternative for local churches who no longer felt that they could remain in the ELCA and work to reform it. In 2001 the organization began with 31 congregations as charter members. As of July 2016 membership was reported as 934 congregations, including 734 US congregations in 41 states, the U.S. Territories of Guam and Puerto Rico, as well as over 100 congregations in 17 other countries (including [[Belarus]], [[Cambodia]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Russia]], and [[Vietnam]]). LCMC is now the fourth largest Lutheran group in the United States, after the ELCA, LCMS, and [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS).
{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=mainline}}

==Polity and beliefs==
LCMC is congregational in structure, rejecting the [[historic episcopate]] of the ELCA, the denomination to which most LCMC members had previously belonged.

The beliefs of the LCMC are based on the [[Bible]] and the Lutheran confessions in the [[Book of Concord]]. On one important issue, LCMC stands apart from other conservative confessional Lutheran denominations: it permits, but does not require the [[ordination of women|ordination of female clergy]]. Some congregations' constitutions and bylaws allow only men to be installed into the Office of Holy Ministry.

LCMC does not bless [[same-sex partnerships]] or permit congregations to be members if they have non-celibate gay pastors or call and install a non-celibate homosexual pastor.

The LCMC has an evangelical catholic and charismatic strand. Many congregations hold to liturgical forms and vested celebrants when leading worship and administering the Sacrament of the Altar. The LCMC brings together the Sacramental, Evangelical and Charismatic nature of the church into one fold.

{{Lutheranism}}
'''The Evangelical Protestant Church (GCEPC),The Lutheran Evangelical Protestant Church (LEPC)''' is a mainline [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denomination under the General Conference of Evangelical Protestant Churches headquartered in Cayce-West Columbia, South Carolina, USA.

The EPC GCEPC/LEPC is one among a number of small Lutheran denominations that came about because of a felt need for sound doctrine and Biblical representation of the Christian faith by its founders.This motivation continues today within the administration and minister members. The LEPC was officially birthed in 2000 and was formed as a non-profit corporation under the Board of Advisors in 2001. The Lutheran Evangelical Protestant Church (EPC/GCEPC LEPC) ministers across the United States of America and around the world. The EPC/LEPC is mission-minded. It is apostolic in focus through church and ministry planting and the training of indigenous ministers for the spreading of the Christian message of faith, grace, and salvation through Jesus Christ in their own nations and cultures.It believes in education and continued personal growth for its ministers. All EPC GCEPC/LEPC ministers have the opportunity to study through their private School Concordia Theologica Institute of Biblical Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lutheranepc.com/concordia.html Concordia Theologica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714003149/http://lutheranepc.com/concordia.html |date=2011-07-14 }}. Lutheranepc.com. Retrieved on 2010-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The EPC GCEPC is a member of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] (NAE) and the [[World Evangelical Alliance]] (WEA).It is a member of the Chaplain's Commission and the Mission America Coalition of the NAE.

Like other Lutheran denominations the LEPC has its roots in the Protestant Reformation.[[Martin Luther]]’s Ninety-Five Theses can be summarized as “Sola Gratia" ("by Divine Grace alone"), Sola Fide  ("by Faith alone”), and Sola Scriptura ("by the Bible alone").  This doctrine of salvation through faith through Divine grace is held to be true by the LEPC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcepc.us/We__Believe.htm gcepc.us. Retrieved on 2013-05-02.]&lt;/ref&gt;   Scripture alone in matters of life, faith, and practice is held to be true rather than the doctrines and traditions of men. These three are considered to be what makes the LEPC “Lutheran.”  The LEPC adheres to the three creeds, Apostles, Nicene, and Athanasian&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds3.i.html Creeds of the Evangelical Protestant Churches. | Christian Classics Ethereal Library]. Ccel.org (2005-07-13). Retrieved on 2010-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; and confesses Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord and the truth and inerrancy of the Holy Scriptures.

# In one God, eternal and self-existent, Creator and Ruler of the Universe, and manifested through the Father, Son and Holy Spirit;(John 1:18, Matthew 3:16-17, John 1:1, Rev 22:13, Romans 9:15)

==Position statements==
The following are the Position Statements of the EPC GCEPC/LEPC as stated on their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lutheranepc.com General Conference of Evangelical Protestant Churches]. Lutheranepc.com. Retrieved on 2010-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baptism:''' "Water baptism identifies the believer with the death and burial of Christ and that the believer should arise to walk in newness of life. (Matthew 28:19-20, Acts 8:26-40) In baptism a believer is identified with Christ whether by immersion, sprinkling, dunking, or pouring where water is provided for such service. Baptism may be by immersion or pouring or sprinkling if water is not available for immersion."

'''Ordination:''' "Ordination into Christian service is for men and woman who have experienced salvation through faith in Christ Jesus and who are baptized believers called by Christ through the Holy Spirit to serve Him in ministry. TheLEPC believes that God has set aside particular individuals for service and that ordination is man’s recognition of what God Himself has already done. Men and women may serve as co-laborers with Christ in the harvest fields. Men and women may serve as deacons, overseers, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelist as examples of all of these can be found in scripture concerning both male and female. From the beginning authority was given to both male and female. In Christ there is neither male nor female, Gentile or Jew, but all are children and servants of God. All are called as a royal priesthood. All levels of leadership are open to spirit led men and women of God."

'''Homosexuality:''' "The Lutheran Evangelical Protestant Church follows the Bible in all matters of faith including the issue of homosexuality. The LEPC will not knowingly ordain any practicing homosexual to the Christian ministry. The belief of the LEPC is that homosexuality should not be an issue causing division and debate within the Church at large, as Holy Scripture already settles the debate. The Christian faith and the love of Christ calls believers to love the sinner but hate the sin. LEPC Clergy minister to all people,welcomes all people following the example of the Lord, Jesus Christ."

'''Marriage:''' "Marriage is the union of a man and a woman. It is a vow made before God that the two (male and female) shall become one. The General Conference of Evangelical Protestant Churches, LEPC and EPC, does not perform same sex unions or bless same sex couples."

'''Abortion:''' "Abortion is the willful taking of innocent human life. Human life begins at conception because there is simply no other point that it can begin. Therefore, abortion is not acceptable under any circumstance except in the rare and unusual instance where the life of the mother is at real risk. Only then should an abortion be considered."

'''Israel and the Jewish People:''' "The Jewish people are God's chosen people. Believers should bless them as scripture says that God will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel. The LEPC/EPC/GCEPC recant and renounce the works and words of Martin Luther concerning the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;[[On the Jews and their Lies]]&lt;/ref&gt; Prayer is offered for the healing of the Jewish people, their peace and their prosperity. Prayer is offered for the peace of Jerusalem.With deep sorrow and regret repentance is offered to the Jewish People for the harm that Martin Luther caused and any contribution to their harm. Forgiveness is requested of the Jewish People for these actions.The Gospel is to the Jew first and then the Gentile. Gentiles (believers in Christ other than Jews) have been grafted into the vine. In Christ there is neither Jew nor Gentile but the Lord's desire is that there be one new man from the two for Christ broke down the wall of separation with His own body (Ephesians 2:14-15).The EPC GCEPC/LEPC blesses Israel and the Jewish people. Prayers are offered for the Middle East and for the salvation and peace of the Arab world."

'''Unity of the Body of Christ:''' "The EPC GCEPC/LEPC, admonishes and encourages "In the essentials unity, in the non-essentials liberty, and in all things charity." The EPC GCEPC/LEPC shares the essentials with our many Christian sisters and brothers and this is necessary to our faith and belief in Jesus Christ for salvation. Many schisms have come in the Body of Christ because of conflicts and disagreements over "non-essentials." In the non-essentials liberty is offered for where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. In all things charity is offered as well as blessing. The EPC GCEPC/LEPC labors alongside others in the Body of Christ in the work of the Lord Jesus Christ as all believers long for His second coming. The Lord Jesus Himself first announced his salvation to world, which cannot be neglected, and God added His witness through signs, wonders, and the distribution of the gifts of the Holy Spirit according to God's will. (Hebrews 2:1-4) The Lord Jesus is the head of God's Church. There are many parts but one Body. Each part of the Body of Christ has been given an assignment from the Lord to fulfill until Jesus' coming. The GCEPC/LEPC/EPC endeavors to complete this work in the spirit of unity and in the bonds of peace."

'''Sexual abuse:''' "Incidents of sexual abuse will be reported to civil authorities. Ministers known as perpetrators will not be reassigned nor will known perpetrators be allowed to continue in ministry with the LEPC/GCEPC."

==Organizational structure==
The LEPC is overseen by the Presiding Bishop with a life appointment . The Board of Advisors appoints the Presiding Bishop with nominations from the Conference. Synod Bishops are appointed by the Presiding Bishop for life with Board of Advisor approval. All Bishops have five year reviews. The Board of Advisors serves in staggered three and two year renewable terms. EPC GCEPC/LEPC congregations and ministries are autonomous. The church is divided into geographical synods and non-geographical synods.Home groups and one new man fellowships are encouraged.

==Role of women==
The EPC GCPEC/LEPC ordains both men and women to the gospel ministry noting that scripture states that in “ Christ Jesus there is neither male not female, Jew or Greek..” Also,noting that the [[Book of Concord]] states that seminaries are for the preparation of men and women but more so that Holy Scripture does not specifically direct yes or no but rather indicates by example that women did pursue the gospel ministry and did serve in positions of authority in Biblical times. The EPC GCEPC/LEPC professes the “priesthood of all believers.” The current and sixth Presiding Bishop of the EPC GCEPC/LEPC is The Most Rev. Nancy Kinard Drew. Both males and females may serve on the Executive and Advisory Boards and the Council of Bishops.

==Apostolic succession==
The EPC GCEPC/LEPC is in historic and valid Apostolic Succession (AS). AS is not required for salvation or for the ordaining of ministers in the LEPC but is done upon request by the laying on of hands for those who understand and value the process and desires this honor. AS serves as a further encouragement and support in the ministry as well as a channel for open doors among certain people groups.

==Sacraments==
The EPC GCEPC/LEPC confesses two sacraments: the Eucharist (Communion, The Lord’s Supper) and Holy Baptism. All believers are welcome at the Lord’s Table. The EPC GCEPC/LEPC will baptize infants but for salvation there must be faith in Christ. As seen by the thief on the cross who was told “Today, you shall be with me in paradise,” there are exceptions to the requirements of baptism. One is not saved through baptism only. Such practice would be empty without faith in Christ but one can be saved by faith in Christ without baptism. Baptism alone does not save. It should not be said "I am saved because I am baptized but rather I am saved because of faith in Christ therefore I am/will be baptized."

==Missions==
The EPC GCEPC/LEPC is Missions oriented and has congregations and church plants in The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Angola and Kenya. Concordia Bible Institute of Kenya prepares indigenous ministers to take the salvation message to their own people.Courses through Concordia Theologica Institute for Biblical Studies are available online anywhere in the world for those who desire to meet the educational requirements of the LEPC and link with the LEPC in ministry.

==Worship==
The EPC GCEPC/LEPC permits a broad range of worship styles from contemporary to traditional to liturgical to renewal/charismatic and messianic.

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=alc}}
The '''Lutheran Ministerium and Synod – USA''' (LMS-USA)  is a small [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Christian]] [[religious denomination|denomination]] based in the [[United States]]. Its congregations are mostly located in the Upper Midwest, and the church body maintains its official headquarters in [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]].

Founded in 1995, the LMS-USA is governed by principles known as [[free church]]. It has a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] governance structure with no [[bishop]]s or district presidents, and the national leadership has "the authority only to advise and recommend" to its member congregations.

==History==

The synod was born when its original member congregations split from the [[American Association of Lutheran Churches]] (AALC), a church that itself had broken with the [[American Lutheran Church]] (ALC) when that body participated in the 1988 merger that formed the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA).

After splitting with the [[American Lutheran Church]] in 1987, the [[American Association of Lutheran Churches|AALC]] originally sought to provide a home for former [[American Lutheran Church|ALC]] parishioners and other Lutherans that would encompass orthodox, charismatic, and evangelical strains of Lutheranism. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, several ministers of the newly formed [[American Association of Lutheran Churches|AALC]] became concerned over the increasing dominance of charismatic or Pentecostal strains of liturgy and theology within the church, particularly at the AALC's new seminary.

This handful of pastors submitted resolutions to the AALC's June 1994 convention that would remove references to the church’s three-strand orientation (orthodox, charismatic, and evangelical), and that would remove from consideration a candidate for a seminary professorship that the pastors found objectionable. After their resolutions failed, three [[American Association of Lutheran Churches|AALC]] congregations left that body and formed the LMS-USA at an April 1995 conference in [[Indianapolis]]. They left in order to uphold the inerrancy of Scripture and to not compromise their stance against the charismatic movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/Lutheranchurches.pdf A Brief Study of the Lutheran Churches in America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121161735/http://clclutheran.org/atlanta/bibleclass/Lutheranchurches.pdf |date=2010-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==

The LMS-USA accepts the inerrancy of scripture and the Lutheran Confessions as found in the [[Book of Concord]]. Congregations have broad latitude in determining the standards for admission to Holy Communion. The LMS-USA describes itself as "moderate or middle-conservative" socially and theologically. According to church documents, the LMS-USA seeks to "fill the gap" in American Lutheranism between the more liberal [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|ELCA]] and what it calls "the conservative to ultra-conservative" approach of the other Lutheran church bodies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;LMS-USA website, [http://www.lmsusa.org/pamodc.htm "Answers to Some Commonly Asked Questions,"] accessed Jul. 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pastoral training==

In fall 1999, the LMS-USA established St. Timothy Lutheran Seminary for the training of clergy in the denomination. The institution is primarily a "seminary without walls," registered in the [[State of Wisconsin]]. Students typically study at one of a number of non-LMS Lutheran or other seminaries, while receiving supervision from the LMS-USA seminary board and faculty and meeting regularly with a mentoring LMS-USA pastor. The LMS-USA also works with graduates of other seminaries, prospective pastors who wish to attend an accredited institution, or second- or third-career individuals considering the ministry in order to map out any additional training which may be required in doctrine or ministerial practice.

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=mainline}}
The '''North American Lutheran Church''' ('''NALC''') is a conservative [[Lutheran]] denomination with over 400 congregations in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], counting more than 141,000 members. As a [[Confessional Lutheran]] church, the NALC believes all doctrines should and must be judged by the teaching of the [[Christian Scriptures]] (the [[Bible]]), in keeping with the historic [[Lutheran Confessions]]. It was established on August 27, 2010.

==History==
The North American Lutheran Church was officially formed in August 2010 as the culmination of a process begun by [[Lutheran CORE]] (Coalition for Renewal), a confessional Lutheran organization which crosses denominational lines. This action came in response to the dissatisfaction of theological conservatives within the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA) and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] (ELCIC) who perceived the ELCA/ELCIC as moving away from the authority of the [[Bible]] and the [[Lutheran Confessions]]. The primary issue of concern for these groups was a 2009 decision by the ELCA which changed its teaching and policy on sexual ethics, allowing clergy / ministers to be in committed [[same-sex relationships]].&lt;ref name=WTLutheranssplit&gt;Julia Duin (Nov. 19, 2010), [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/nov/19/conservative-lutherans-to-leave-synod/?page=all "Lutherans Second Church to Split Over Gays"], ''Washington Times''. Accessed October 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Following Lutheran CORE's national convocation in September 2009, which resolved to pursue the "reconfiguration of North American Lutheranism", the organization's leaders released a plan for organizing the North American Lutheran Church on February 18, 2010.&lt;ref name="Vision/Plan"&gt;[http://thenalc.org/documents/NALC-Lutheran-CORE-Vision-and-Plan-2-18-2010.pdf ''A Vision and Plan for The North American Lutheran Church and Lutheran CORE, a Community of Confessing Lutherans''], Lutheran CORE, February 18, 2010. Accessed October 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was felt that a new church body was needed for those Lutheran congregations who declined to join already existing conservative Lutheran groups established earlier in American history or upon earlier Lutheran denominational mergers or splits in 1960, 1962, and 1988.

The new church was constituted in [[Grove City, Ohio]], at the Lutheran CORE national convocation of August 26–27, 2010. The convocation was attended by approximately 1000 participants, including representatives of several conservative American or international denominations, such as the [[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]], the [[Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania]], and the [[Anglican Church in North America]]. A constitution was adopted and provisional leaders were elected, including the Rev. Paull Spring of [[State College, Pennsylvania]], a retired ELCA [[bishop]], to serve as provisional bishop of the NALC for its first year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenalc.org/history/ NALC History, NALC Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The congregations that joined the NALC elected their own leaders at the church body's first annual meeting on August 11–12, 2011, at [[Upper Arlington Lutheran Church]] in [[Hilliard, Ohio]]. The Rev. [[John Bradosky]] of [[Centerville, Ohio]], NALC General Secretary, was elected as bishop of the NALC at that meeting to serve a four-year term. During the NALC's 2015 Annual Convocation in [[Dallas, Texas]], he was re-elected to a second four-year term.

==Beliefs==
The North American Lutheran Church understands itself to be part of the [[Four Marks of the Church|one holy, catholic, and apostolic church]] and holds that the Scriptures are the highest standard by which doctrine and practice are to be judged. It accepts the [[ecumenical creeds]] and the [[Lutheran Confessions]] as "true witnesses to the Word of God".&lt;ref name=Confession&gt;North American Lutheran Church, [http://thenalc.org/christ-centered-confession-of-faith.htm "Confession of Faith"], accessed October 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The North American Lutheran Church officially disapproves of homosexual relationships and same-sex marriage. Bishop [[John Bradosky]] joined other religious leaders in the open letter, "Marriage and Religious Freedom: Fundamental Goods That Stand or Fall Together - An Open Letter from Religious Leaders in the United States to All Americans", released in January 12, 2012, on his support for the protection of marriage as the union between a man and a woman and in opposition to same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenalc.org/documents/news-releases/2012/NALC-NEWS-12JAN2012-001-Marriage-and-Religious-Freedom.htm Bishop Bradosky joins American religious leaders in defending marriage and religious freedom, January 12, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; John Bradosky was one of the signants, among other American religious leaders, of the open letter "Free Exercise on Religion: Putting Beliefs into Practice", expressing his support for the Roman Catholic Church in her opposition to the HHS mandate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/religious-liberty/fortnight-for-freedom/upload/Free-Exercise-of-Religion-Putting-Beliefs-into-Practice.pdf Free Exercise of Religion: Putting Beliefs into Practice - An Open Letter from Religious Leaders in the United States to all Americans]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Commission on Theology and Doctrine of the North American Lutheran Church and Lutheran CORE endorsed a pro-life stance on abortion in the document "The Lord Is with You" - A Word of Counsel to the Church - The Sanctity of Nascent Life", on December 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenalc.org/documents/Word-of-Counsel-on-Sanctity-of-Nascent-Life.pdf "The Lord Is with You" - A Word of Counsel to the Church on the Sanctity of Nascent Life", Joint Commission on Theology and Doctrine of the North American Lutheran Church and Lutheran CORE, December 14, 2012]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American Lutheran Church became associated with Lutherans For Life, the pro-life ministry of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], for the promotion of pro-life activism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lutheransforlife.org/ Lutherans For Life Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The membership of the North American Lutheran Church is composed of congregations and ordained pastors who have subscribed to the church's constitution.&lt;ref name=Const6.01&gt;[http://thenalc.org/documents/governance/NALC-2011-Constitution-Approved-By-Convocation-V1.pdf Constitution of the North American Lutheran Church], Article 6.01. August 15, 2011. Accessed October 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Provided that member congregations' beliefs and practices are compatible with the NALC, congregations can simultaneously affiliate with other Lutheran church bodies. Ministers and elected lay delegates represent their congregations in the annual convocation. This body elects the bishop, executive council, and other leadership positions. It also approves budgetary items and teaching statements.&lt;ref name=Const7&gt;Constitution, Article 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain actions of the convocation, such as constitutional amendments and teaching statements, must first be ratified by a majority or, in some cases, a two-thirds majority of NALC congregations before they take effect.&lt;ref name=Const7,17&gt;Constitution, Articles 7 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The North American Lutheran Church is divided into 24 mission districts, usually based on geographical groupings of congregations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenalc.org/mission-districts/ NALC Mission Districts]&lt;/ref&gt; Regional [[Dean (Christianity)#Lutheran Church|deans]], who may also serve as pastors of local congregations, work with the bishop to provide oversight and pastoral care to pastors and congregations within their mission districts.&lt;ref name=Const11&gt;Constitution, Article 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop is an ordained minister elected by the convocation. The bishop serves as "pastor for the pastors and congregations of the NALC" and as the church's chief executive officer. Together with the executive council, the bishop authorizes all ordinations and conducts the rite of ordination.&lt;ref name=Const8&gt;Constitution, Article 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop serves for a four-year term and is eligible to serve for a maximum of three consecutive terms. The general secretary is appointed by the bishop and confirmed by the executive council. This officer manages the day-to-day administrative functions of the NALC.&lt;ref name=Const9&gt;Constitution, Article 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The executive council consists of the bishop, four clergy and four lay members. Its duties include implementing the work and policies of the NALC in between sessions of convocation, and its actions are subject to review by the convocation.&lt;ref name=Const10&gt;Constitution, Article 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A seven-member Court of Adjudication, elected by the annual convocation, has jurisdiction to decide appeals of church disciplinary actions and has authority to interpret church governing documents. The convocation can overturn the court's interpretation of a governing document by amending the document in question.&lt;ref name=Const15&gt;Constitution, Article 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with other churches==
The NALC Convocation, held in August 2011, approved unanimously the establishment of a full communion relationship with the [[Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenalc.org/wp-content/uploads/News/2011%20Archive/NALC-August-2011-v2.pdf Convocation approves full communion relationship with Ethiopian Lutherans, NALC News, August 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; A "Memorandum of Understanding" between the NALC and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania]] was approved at the Convocation held at August 2013, paving the way for full communion between the two churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenalc.org/wp-content/uploads/Documents/Ecumenical/Memorandum-of-Understanding-ELCT-and-NALC-08-08-2013.pdf Memorandum of Understanding between The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania and The North American Lutheran Church, NALC Official Website, 8 August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NALC has established ecumenical dialogue with other Lutheran church bodies, such as the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], the [[Lutheran Church-Canada]] and the [[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]], as well as with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Anglican Church in North America]], and the [[Eastern Orthodox Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenalc.org/ecumenical-and-other-relationships/ An Initial Statement on the Ecumenical and Inter-Lutheran Commitment of the North American Lutheran Church, NALC Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The NALC passed a request to the Anglican Church in North America to share clergy where there were vacancies, which was accepted. The NALC also started a seminary system called the [[North American Lutheran Seminary]] on the campus of [[Trinity School for Ministry]], an ACNA school. Many NALC students also attend the pan-Lutheran [[Institute of Lutheran Theology]], located in [[Brookings, South Dakota]]

The NALC held an ecumenical summit with representatives of the Anglican Church in North America, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod] and the Lutheran Church-Canada, on May 3–5, 2013, at the Church of the Holy Communion in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], on the theme of "Biblical Teaching on Marriage and Sexuality". The summit issued the joint document "An Affirmation of Marriage", signed by representatives of all the four church bodies, which defined the institution of marriage as the unity between a man and a woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenalc.org/the-nalc-releases-ecumenical-affirmation-on-marriage/ The NALC Releases Ecumenical Affirmation on Marriage, North American Lutheran Church Official Website, 10 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=awakening}}
The '''Old Apostolic Lutheran Church of America''' (OALC) is a [[The Firstborn Laestadianism|Firstborn Laestadian]] church in North America. Firstborn Laestadians are a subgroup within [[Laestadianism]]. The Old Apostolic Lutheran Church originated in the 1890s. In the Nordic Firstborn Laestadian revival, the movement works within the official [[Church of Sweden]], which is also called the "Lutheran Folk Church". The Church of Sweden has for a long time recognized the Laestadian movement and has allowed them to hold their own services in the state churches, both before and after the separation of church and state. Even in America it still has a relationship with the Church of Sweden.

==Doctrine==
The OALC believes in the [[Trinity]]: the [[God the Father|Father]], the [[God the Son|Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]. It confesses the [[Bible|Holy Bible]], consisting of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] testaments, as the only unchangeable Word of God for salvation and the standard by which all doctrines of salvation should be examined. The OALC accepts the [[Apostles' Creed]], the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]], the Unaltered [[Augsburg Confession]], and the original doctrine of [[Martin Luther]], [[Lars Levi Laestadius]], and the elders of this church in Swedish Lapland in this era (known as the Church of Firstborn).&lt;ref&gt;Perustus ja Sivu Lait 1947, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The Old Apostolic Lutheran Church has approximately 25,000 members and is the largest Laestadian/Apostolic Lutheran church in America. At its beginning in about 1900, it was a small group when the Laestadian movement in America was splintered, giving rise to the "New Apostolic Lutheran Church" and the "Old Apostolic Lutheran Church." Originally, the OALC had only a few church buildings, and services were usually held in homes. During the twentieth and twenty-first centuries the OALC had grown due primarily to the belief in, and creation of, large families.

The Old Apostolic Lutheran Church of America is the nationwide ecclesiastical association, and has member congregations in the following states: [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[South Dakota]], [[North Dakota]], [[North Carolina]], [[Delaware]], [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]] and [[Wisconsin]]. The most significant membership is in southwest area of the state of Washington, with approximately 6,000 members. Other large congregations are located in [[Lake Norden, South Dakota]] (2000); [[Hancock, Michigan]] (800); [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] (1200);[[Duluth, Minnesota]] (1600); and [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] (800). The OALC also has congregations in [[Canada]] and in [[Alaska]]. In the Battle Ground area of Washington, churches now exist in [[Brush Prairie, Washington|Brush Prairie]], [[Lewisville, Washington|Lewisville]], Heisson,  [[Woodland, Washington|Woodland]], and Yacolt. A future church is being planned for Battle Ground. This large number of Old Apostolic Lutherans is concentrated in the central and northern sections of [[Clark County, Washington]]. In the Columbian's interview, Dale Schlecht, who is one of the preachers at the Brush Prairie church in Clark county, said there is no way to ascertain the exact number of members, because the church does not keep a roster of membership.

Old Apostolic Lutherans - as all Firstborn Laestadians - greet each other with the phrase; "God's peace!" This is a shorter form of the greeting "May God's peace be with you." This is believed to be the highest greeting that one OALC member can offer to another.&lt;ref&gt;History of Living Christianity in America 1999, 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kulla, 2004, 86, 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Foltz - Yliniemi 2005, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Columbian&gt;Achen, Paris, 2014, What is the Old Apostolic Lutheran Church?
- [http://www4.columbian.com/news/2012/feb/27/raising-a-church-growing-lutheran-congregation-put/] Accessed August 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old Apostolic Lutheran Church of America is an independent church, but from the beginning it has had close ties to Scandinavian countries and Finland. It is a sister organization to the Firstborn Laestadians of Finland and Scandinavian countries. The global Firstborn Laestadian movement in America, Finland, Denmark, and Norway is under the care and supervision of the [[Elders of Swedish Lapland]]. The Firstborn Laestadian movement in Swedish Lapland is understood and accepted as the mother congregation to which all the American congregations look for guidance. Being under the supervision of the elders of Swedish Lapland keeps the church in both outward unity and spiritual unity.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kulla, 2004, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministers and activities==
The Old Apostolic Lutheran Church had thirty-eight preachers in the beginning of 2000s. The OALC is lay oriented and has a layman approach to the ministry, meaning the preachers are not paid by the church and the preachers do not have a theological education or ordination. However, they do have a procedure for training their preachers. New preachers are selected by the congregation and the existing preachers. Preachers are expected to work full-time to support their families while also maintaining their preachers' responsibilities to the congregation. Each local congregation has many preachers and no one preacher preaches every Sunday; rather they take turns preaching. Once a person is chosen as a preacher, they generally serve for the rest of their lives. Some preachers are put on missionary work and they are called as missionary men or missionary preachers. Missionary men travel on missions and hold meetings in United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;History of Living Christianity in America 1999, 88, 119, 121-123, 126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kulla, 2004, 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northwestanglican.blogspot.fi/2007/07/apostolic-lutheranism-theology-and_26.html|title=Apostolic Lutheranism: Theology and Practice|website=northwestanglican.blogspot.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Columbian /&gt; Communion services are held on the first Sunday of every month, which is designated as Communion Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;History of Living Christianity in America 1999, 8, 32, 47, 50, 68, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Sunday School is also held.&lt;ref&gt;History of Living Christianity in America 1999, 70, 78, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; In the OALC lay preachers function as pastors, they preach in services and administer baptism and communion. Preachers distribute communion, but if they don't have enough preachers, then male parishioners may help. Preachers also officiate at funeral services, but only those preachers who have licenses from the state conduct weddings.

The OALC was the first Laestadian church which had English-speaking preachers. This began in 1899. The prevalent language is English, although sermons have been translated from Finnish into English to some degree. They still read Laestadius' sermons in their services. OALC activities are traditional Laestadian. OALC traditionally holds special Christmas and midsummer services, as in Scandinavia. The Christmas services alternate among Minneapolis, Detroit, Newark, and Brush Prairie. In Alaska they also hold mission services.&lt;ref&gt;Foltz - Yliniemi 2005, 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The church does not publish its own periodical, but [http://www.rauhanside.fi ''Rauhan Side''] (''Bond of Peace'') is read to some degree, although it is in Finnish and published in Finland with only with a short English summary of the main articles. Several books of Laestadius' sermons have been translated and published, as well as his book ''Ens Ropandes röst I öknen'' (''The Voice of One Crying in the Wilderness'').&lt;ref&gt;Foltz - Yliniemi 2005, 198-199&lt;/ref&gt; OALC's preacher Henrik Koller (1859–1935) published his own periodical, ''Sion’s News'', from 1891 to 1896.&lt;ref&gt;History of Living Christianity in America 1999, 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Achen, Paris, 2014, What is the Old Apostolic Lutheran Church? - [http://www.firstthings.com/marriage-pledge] Referred 12 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The OALC has published Luther's Small Catechism for younger children and Bible History for teenagers. It has published its own hymnal and altar book. The OALC has published ''The Fathers Voice'' vol. I-III (1969-1989), which are English translations of the Swedish periodical ''Fadersrösten'', edited by Firstborn Laestadian preacher Sam Wettainen. The King James Version (KJV) is the Bible translation used in the OALC.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=synodical}}
The '''Orthodox Lutheran Confessional Conference''' is a group of independent [[Lutheran]] [[Local church|congregation]]s. The OLCC was organized in 2006 after their charter congregations left the [[Lutheran Churches of the Reformation]].

== Organizational structure ==
The OLCC consists of independent Lutheran congregations who are united in doctrine and practice. It has no political structure, treasury, or form of government. The pastoral conference has a chairman who serves as a point of contact for outside groups and congregations.

== Doctrine and Practice ==
The OLCC professes that the [[Book of Concord]] is in complete agreement with the teachings of the [[Bible]]. In Lutheranism, this is known as a [[Confessional Lutheran#.22Quia.22 versus .22Quatenus.22 subscription|quia subscription]].

The following beliefs distinguish this group from others which likewise profess a quia subscription.

=== The Church ===
* Only the local congregation is a body of [[Christian]]s that has the right to establish the ministry in its midst.
* Other organizations which congregations may join have no [[God|divine authority]] whatsoever.
* The spiritual rule of a congregation is given to the Office of the [[Christian ministry|Ministry]], whose [[incumbent]]s serve at the behest of God and the congregation. The spiritual rule is the rule of the [[Religious text|Word of God]].
* The external governing of a congregation may be carried out in any number of ways, as the circumstances require. Thus church boards, voter's assemblies, general ][[consensus]], or [[pastoral]] rule are all valid forms of external church government.
* The external government of the church is limited to matters which in themselves are not spiritual, such as the holding and maintenance of property, scheduling of meetings, etc. It must yield to the spiritual rule in all matters where the spiritual and external rule intersect.
* Nevertheless, the external government cannot violate God's own commands as to how the church should be governed. Thus those who rule the church even in its external aspects must still be male, and rule according to love, etc.
* Though a congregation may be organized in any number of forms ([[corporation]], [[trust law|trust]], [[house church]], etc.) these forms do not in any way alter the spiritual nature or existence of that congregation. The elimination or conversion of the external form does not eliminate or alter the congregation itself, provided the congregation is still a group of Christians who continue to gather regularly around the Word and [[sacrament]]s, with the office of the ministry established in their midst.

=== The Ministry ===
* The Office of the Ministry, the Office of the Keys, and the Preaching Office are all synonymous.
* This office belongs to the whole church. Emergencies excepted, the church exercises the office by filling it, and also when practicing [[excommunication]].
* The office is filled when the local church issues a call to a qualified man, who then accepts this call. This call is considered to be a mediate [[divine call]], where God works through the local congregation as His instrument.
* Only the local congregation is a church that can issue a divine call. Other organizations cannot, because only the local congregation meets regularly, in a particular place, around the means of [[Divine grace|Grace]] (which are defined as the word and the sacraments), all other groups being of a transitory nature.
* Though a local congregation may ask for assistance in choosing a candidate for the [[Christian ministry|ministry]], the right to issue a divine call cannot be transferred from the local congregation to another body. It is always the local congregation that calls.
* The essential duties of this office are [[preaching]], teaching, and administering the sacraments.
* Individuals in this office may, by human arrangement, be divided into different branches, such as [[pastor]], assistant pastor, [[seminary]] [[professor]], [[evangelism|evangelist]] ([[missionary]]), [[vicar]], etc., but each has the full office and can therefore rightly preach, teach, and administer the sacraments.
* No minister can by divine right claim a rank higher than any other minister, all incumbents in the ministry being equals.
* An incumbent in this office may have helpers who assist him in his duties, but those helpers cannot "borrow" his call. Therefore, in the church, emergencies excepted, they may not preach, teach, or administer the sacraments without themselves having a divine call and being installed into the Office of the Ministry.

{{Lutheranism in the United States|expanded=synodical}}
The '''United Lutheran Mission Association''' ('''ULMA''') is a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church organization.

==History==
The '''United Lutheran Mission Association''' was established at a meeting in [[Chicago]] on July 16, 2005. There, representatives of two congregations that were formerly members of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS), namely, Pilgrim Lutheran Church of [[Decatur, Illinois]] and Redeemer Lutheran Church of [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan]], began work on establishing [[Confessional Lutheran]] congregations in the United States. A third congregation, Our Redeemer Lutheran Church of [[Forsyth, Illinois]], joined on December 15, 2011. As of 2013, the ULMA has two mission congregations: Agnus Dei in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], whose first service was in December, 2007; and Christ the Rock Lutheran Church of [[Carlsbad, California]], whose first service was February 8, 2009.

==Structure==
The ULMA, like the [[Protes'tant Conference]], is congregationalist in polity. The voters assembly is the supreme authority in the congregation. There is no central office or centralized organizational structure other than the individual representatives who meet twice each year. The ULMA plans to train its own pastors at [[Walther Theological Seminary]], but as of 2014 has had no graduates.&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/unitedlutheranmission/conversations/topics/97&lt;/ref&gt; The ULMA has obtained clergy trained in the seminaries of other Lutheran denominations, such as the LCMS, the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod]].

The '''Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod''' ('''WELS''') is an American [[Confessional Lutheran]] denomination of Christianity. Characterized as [[Christian theology|theologically]] conservative, it was founded in 1850 in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. As of 2017,  it had a [[Baptism#Protestant Reformation|baptized]] membership of 363,997 in 1,275 [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregations]], with churches in 47 US states and 4 provinces of Canada.&lt;ref name="WELS ANUAL REPORT 2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://synodadmin.welsrc.net/download-synodadmin/official-synod-reports/?wpdmdl=3263&amp;ind=jB60u3WdDXqHOH384f6pPdKUKanA5Z0kuM_xVE_xGVE4t6BxQbx1_jezDCcPU2d2z3wMSXOS7r_2Nw2VHNebug |title= Your Gifts, God's Blessings: An Annual Report to Our Members |publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod |accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the third largest Lutheran denomination in the United States. The WELS school system is the fourth largest private school system in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=T.|last2=Carper|first2=J.|title=The Praeger Handbook of Faith-Based Schools in the United States, K-12, Volume 1|year=2012|pages=177|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=0313391394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WELS is in fellowship with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (ELS) and is a member of the [[Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference]] (CELC), a worldwide organization of Lutheran church bodies of the same beliefs.

== Belief and practice ==

=== Doctrinal standards ===
The WELS subscribes to the [[Protestant Reformation|Lutheran Reformation]] teaching of ''[[Sola scriptura]]''—"Scripture alone." It holds that the [[Bible]] is the final authority by which church teachings can be judged. It also holds that the Bible is explained and interpreted by the 16th century [[Book of Concord]] ''because'' it teaches and faithfully explains the Bible. As such, pastors and congregations within the WELS agree to teach in accordance with it.

The WELS also agrees with the doctrine of [[Biblical inerrancy]], the doctrine that the Bible is inspired by God and is without error (2 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1:20-21, 1 Corinthians 2:13, John 17:17, Psalm 12:6, Titus 1:2). For this reason, they reject much of modern [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] scholarship.

=== Differences from Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod ===
The main facets of doctrinal difference between the WELS and the LCMS include:

* ''Fellowship'' – The WELS teaches that all forms of Christian fellowship require complete unity in matters of doctrine (Romans 16:17, Ephesians 4:3-6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wels.net/about-wels/what-we-believe/doctrinal-statements/church-fellowship/|title=Church Fellowship|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409210236/https://wels.net/about-wels/what-we-believe/doctrinal-statements/church-fellowship/|archivedate=April 9, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LCMS, meanwhile, teaches that there are different levels of fellowship among Christians, so that altar fellowship (sharing in the [[Eucharist]] together), pulpit fellowship (exchange of preaching privileges among ministers of various congregations), and other manifestations of Christian fellowship (such as fellowship in prayer), are distinct. Thus, according to LCMS doctrine, members of different church bodies can engage in greater or lesser degrees of fellowship depending on the extent of their doctrinal disagreement.
* ''Doctrine of the ministry'' – The WELS believes that there are many different forms of one, divinely established Ministry. These forms of the Ministry include pastor, Christian day-school teacher, staff-minister and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wels.net/about-wels/what-we-believe/doctrinal-statements/church-and-ministry/|title=Church and Ministry|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312091737/https://wels.net/about-wels/what-we-believe/doctrinal-statements/church-and-ministry/|archivedate=March 12, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LCMS teaches that only the pastoral office is divinely established, while all other church offices are human institutions.
* ''Role of women in the church'' – The LCMS and WELS agree that Scriptures reserve the pastoral office for men. In "This We Believe," published in 1999, WELS states that "women may participate in offices and activities of the public ministry except where that work involves authority over men (1 Timothy 2:11,12). This means that women may not serve as pastors nor participate in assemblies of the church in ways that exercise authority over men (1 Corinthians 11:3; 14:33–35)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102192641/http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?2617&amp;collectionID=783&amp;contentID=4433&amp;shortcutID=4869 WELS beliefs]&lt;/ref&gt; WELS does not allow women suffrage in congregational matters that would exercise authority over men. LCMS teaches that women may take on roles of lay authority in the church, such as voting in church elections and serving in "humanly established offices" such as congregation president, reader, or member of church councils, including elected executive roles in the church.

=== Differences from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ===
* ''Scriptural interpretation'' – The WELS confesses that the Bible is the inspired, inerrant and infallible Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1:20-21, 1 Corinthians 2:13, John 17:17, Psalm 12:6, Titus 1:2) and follows a [[Historical-grammatical method|Historical-Grammatical]] approach to interpretation. The meaning of a portion of Scripture is discerned by paying careful attention to grammar, syntax, vocabulary and context. In this regard, the historical setting forms part of the context of Scripture, the text itself indicating how important a part. The ELCA, on the other hand, has been open to [[Historical-Critical Method]]s of Biblical interpretation which seek to understand the scriptures with primary reference to historical and social context. Most other specific doctrinal differences between the two churches stem from this overarching disagreement.
* ''Creation'' – The WELS teaches that the account of creation given in Genesis 1–3 is a factual, historical account,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wels.net/what-we-believe/statements-beliefs/this-we-believe/creation-man-and-sin |title=Statement of Beliefs - II. Creation, Man, and Sin|accessdate=2011-06-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720144535/http://www.wels.net/what-we-believe/statements-beliefs/this-we-believe/creation-man-and-sin |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ELCA has not enforced an official position, allowing members to embrace positions ranging from strict [[creationism]] to [[Evolutionary creationism|theistic evolution]].
* ''Sexuality'' – The WELS teaches that extramarital sex (1 Corinthians 7:2, Hebrews 13:4) and homosexual relations (Romans 1:18-32, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, 1 Timothy 8-11) are sins, while the ELCA and its predecessor churches are open to multiple viewpoints on these matters. The ELCA officially permits the ordination of monogamous non-celibate homosexuals and the blessing of homosexual couples. In 2008, 37% of ELCA pastors were found to support [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Jones and Daniel Cox. ''[http://www.publicreligion.org/objects/uploads/fck/file/CVS%20Theology%20and%20LGBT.pdf Mainline Protestant Clergy Views on Theology and Gay and Lesbian Issues: Findings from the 2008 Clergy Voices Survey]''. p. 7. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821140414/http://www.publicreligion.org/objects/uploads/fck/file/CVS%20Theology%20and%20LGBT.pdf |date=August 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Fellowship'' – The WELS teaches that churches must agree on all doctrines of Scripture before they can enjoy any form of fellowship with each other (Romans 16:17, Ephesians 4:3-6), while the ELCA teaches that agreement on all aspects of doctrine is not necessarily required as a prerequisite for fellowship. It thus practices fellowship with a handful of other [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] denominations.
* ''Role of women in the church'' – The WELS holds that, according to Scripture, women may not serve as clergy nor vote within their congregations where authority is exercised over men (see above), while the ELCA's three predecessor churches began ordaining women into the ministry in the 1970s, according to their interpretation of Scripture.
* ''Communion'' – The WELS practices [[closed communion]] (1 Corinthians 10:16-17, 1 Corinthians 1:10, 1 Corinthians 11:26-32); it holds that the [[Eucharist]] is reserved for confirmed members of the WELS, any sister church in fellowship with WELS, and other individuals found upon examination to be in doctrinal agreement with the WELS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wels.net/faq/close-communion-and-membership/|title=Close communion and membership|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023220234/http://wels.net/faq/close-communion-and-membership/|archivedate=October 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antichrist===
The WELS believes that the [[Pope as Antichrist|Papacy is the Antichrist]] ([[2 Thessalonians 2|2 Thessalonians]] {{Bibleverse-nb||2 Thessalonians|2:1-12|ESV}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wels.net/about-wels/what-we-believe/doctrinal-statements/antichrist/|title=Antichrist|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117214757/https://wels.net/about-wels/what-we-believe/doctrinal-statements/antichrist/|archivedate=November 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the WELS formally issued its ''Statement on the Antichrist'', a [[doctrinal statement]] that declared: "we reaffirm the statement of the Lutheran Confessions, that 'the Pope is the very Antichrist'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holywordcafe.com/bible/resources/WrightAntichrist.PDF |title=“The Pope is the Very Antichrist” A Necessary Conviction of the 21st Century Christian |first=Chad |last=Wright |date=May 12, 2000 |accessdate=2011-02-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712214224/http://www.holywordcafe.com/bible/resources/WrightAntichrist.PDF |archivedate=July 12, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This identification of the Antichrist with the Pope is part of the traditional [[Historicist interpretations of the Book of Revelation|Protestant apocalyptic historicism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/eschatology/reformedescha.html |title=Reformed Eschatology (Amillennial) Since the Reformation |first=Charles J. | last=Terpstra |date=October 15, 1999 |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017030826/http://www.mountainretreatorg.net/eschatology/reformedescha.html |archivedate=October 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"All Roads Lead to Rome?: The Ecumenical Movement”; Publisher: Dorchester House Publications; 1993; pp. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehorsemedia.com/articles/?d=44 The Anti-Christ and The Protestant Reformation], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110013728/http://www.whitehorsemedia.com/articles/?d=44 |date=November 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[End time#Christianity|End times]]). Mark Schroeder, president of WELS, affirmed in 2011 that "WELS does hold to the historic Lutheran position that the Roman Catholic papacy fits the biblical characteristics of the Antichrist". He also stated that "While WELS continues to see the characteristics of the Antichrist in the Roman Catholic papacy, it is wrong and dishonest to portray this belief as stemming from [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] bigotry. We do have strong convictions, and we identify what we believe are teachings that depart from the Word of God. But we hold no animosity toward Christians who hold the Roman Catholic faith, and we respect the right of people to hold beliefs different from ours even as we point out the error. Furthermore, we rejoice that even in the Roman Catholic Church, where we believe that the gospel has been distorted, there are many Catholics who hold to a simple faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior and who will ultimately be saved. Testifying to the errors that still exist in Catholic doctrine is itself an expression of love; remaining silent or glossing over doctrinal differences would express the opposite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schroeder|first=Mark|title=The WELS view: By Scripture alone|url=http://www.wels.net/news-events/wels-view-scripture-alone-0|accessdate=July 25, 2011|newspaper=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722181258/http://www.wels.net/news-events/wels-view-scripture-alone-0|archivedate=July 22, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Beginning ===

The WELS's direct predecessor, known as ''The German Evangelical Ministerium of Wisconsin'' was founded in 1850 by several churches in and around Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Many of the early pastors were educated and trained by mission societies in Germany. The early churches in the Wisconsin Synod had a strong German background; services and church business were conducted in German. Many of the pastors and congregations brought with them a tolerance towards forming joint congregations with the [[Reformed]], similar to the [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Union Churches]] they left behind in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Roy A Suelflow.''Walking With Wise Men''. Milwaukee: [[South Wisconsin District (LCMS)]], 1967, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, the ''German Evangelical Lutheran synod of Wisconsin'' was incorporated by an act of the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;See this list of [https://books.google.com/books?id=7gIrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA119 Private and local laws passed by the Legislature of Wisconsin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427094119/https://books.google.com/books?id=7gIrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA119 |date=April 27, 2016 }} for the text of the Act.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General Council ===
In the 1860s, the Wisconsin Synod became increasingly conservative along the Lutheran viewpoint and against the Reformed. In the synod convention of 1867, the synod joined the [[General Council (Lutheran)|General Council]], a group of [[Neolutheran]] synods that left the [[General Synod]] because it sought to compromise Lutheran doctrine in order to join with non-Lutheran American Protestantism. However, some pastors in the Wisconsin Synod agreed with the "[[open questions]]" position of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Iowa|Iowa Synod]] that some doctrines could be left unresolved and good Lutherans could agree to disagree about them.&lt;ref name=S107&gt;Roy A Suelflow.''Walking With Wise Men''. Milwaukee: [[South Wisconsin District (LCMS)|South Wisconsin District of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], 1967, p.107.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1868 convention witnessed a meaningful discussion on the topic of pulpit and altar fellowship, one of the [[General Council (Lutheran)#List of Four Points|Four Points in American Lutheranism]]. Although there were several dissenting opinions, most of the pastors and lay delegates realized that they could not in good conscience exchange pastors with non-Lutherans or invite them to commune at their altar. They felt that the [[General Council (Lutheran)#Origin of the Four Points in American Lutheranism|position the General Council took]] on this subject was inadequate. They resolved that, unless it changed course, they would withdraw from the General Council.&lt;ref name=S107 /&gt;

=== Synodical Conference ===
[[File:St John's Evangelical Lutheran Church.jpg|thumb|200px|The Synodical Conference was founded in [[St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church Complex|St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], which at the time held membership in the Wisconsin Synod.]]
Following the 1868 convention, representatives of the Wisconsin and Missouri Synods held a meeting in Milwaukee during October 21–22, 1868.&lt;ref name=S107/&gt; They discussed various points of doctrine, writing an agreement recognizing the Missouri and Wisconsin synods as [[Lutheran Orthodoxy|orthodox Lutheran]] church bodies and that they have pulpit and altar fellowship together. The agreement noted that in the event a doctrinal error arose in one of the two synods, they would not question each other's orthodoxy as long as they both used all Christian means at their disposal to resolve the problem. This agreement was later adopted by each of the synods in convention.&lt;ref&gt;Roy A Suelflow.''Walking With Wise Men''. Milwaukee: [[South Wisconsin District (LCMS)]], 1967, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio|Ohio Synod]] invited the Wisconsin Synod, [[Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Illinois|Illinois Synod]], Missouri Synod, and [[Synod of the Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Norwegian Synod]], to Chicago on January 11–13, 1871. There the synods drew up a document of association for the synods to vote on at their next convention. They also invited the entire membership, both teachers and pastors, of all the synods to attend a general convention the next year. This first meeting of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America]], commonly called the "Synodical Conference", was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on July 10–16, 1872. They wrote the constitution to the Synodical Conference, which arranged the synods together as a federation and did not vest any real authority with the Synodical Conference, either at the convention or board level.&lt;ref&gt;Roy A Suelflow.''Walking With Wise Men''. Milwaukee: [[South Wisconsin District (LCMS)]], 1967, p.109.&lt;/ref&gt; The fellowship union included full communion among members, the sharing of educational facilities, joint mission and benevolence work, and open pulpit between pastors of the different synods.

==== Reorganization ====
The first convention of the Synodical Conference also endeavored to reduce the severe competition between synods. The delegates planned to reorganize all Synodical Conference Lutherans into separate state synods, although allowing for separate organization along the lines of the three languages—German, Norwegian, and English.&lt;ref&gt;Roy A Suelflow.''Walking With Wise Men''. Milwaukee: [[South Wisconsin District (LCMS)]], 1967, p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1876 and 1877 conventions also took up this cause, and added to it the goal of providing centrally located ministerial and teacher education campuses. The Minnesota Synod favored the approach of organizing state synods, but only if they would be independent of the larger Ohio and Missouri Synods.&lt;ref&gt;Roy A Suelflow.''Walking With Wise Men''. Milwaukee: [[South Wisconsin District (LCMS)]], 1967, p.112.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the  Wisconsin Synod desired organization along state lines, but only on the condition that they would be prohibited from joining any larger synodical body, that is, the already existing Ohio and Missouri Synods. The Wisconsin Synod also did not think that it could derive any benefit out of a centrally run seminary. In response to this strained relation between the Wisconsin Synod and the other synods, the Synodical Conference elected a committee made up of Wisconsin Synod delegates and other synods' representatives to repair relations with the Wisconsin Synod in time for the next convention in 1878.&lt;ref name=S113&gt;Roy A Suelflow.''Walking With Wise Men''. Milwaukee: [[South Wisconsin District (LCMS)]], 1967, p.113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, the Wisconsin Synod withdrew its demand that the state synods had to be independent of the Missouri or Ohio Synods.&lt;ref name=S113/&gt; The Missouri Synod needed to build a new seminary, since location at its current campus was strained. Although there was considerable plans to build a new joint Synodical Conference seminary outside of Chicago, because of the hesitance of the Wisconsin Synod on this subject and the inability of any of the other members besides Missouri to contribute financially to the new project, it was tabled, and ultimately never happened.&lt;ref&gt;Roy A Suelflow.''Walking With Wise Men''. Milwaukee: [[South Wisconsin District (LCMS)]], 1967, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1878 convention voted in favor of establishing state synods. These state synods were to organize into two or three larger synods, one for the east (corresponding to the Ohio Synod), one for the southwest (corresponding to the Missouri Synod), and one for the northwest (which would include all congregations in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, the Dakotas and all parts west). This formed three larger synods, which solved the longstanding concern that if either the Missouri or Ohio synods were allowed to keep their identity, they would dominate the rest of the Synodical Conference, or, even worse, the Minnesota or Wisconsin Synods would be forced to join one of them. This new organization did not apply to congregations speaking Norwegian, and English speaking congregations were to organize as separate district synods within one of the three larger synods&lt;ref&gt;Roy A Suelflow.''Walking With Wise Men''. Milwaukee: [[South Wisconsin District (LCMS)]], 1967, p.115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Schism ====
The Synodical Conference split when the Ohio Synod left the Synodical Conference in 1881 over the issue of whether God predestined people according to his foreknowledge of whether they would come to faith.  The Ohio Synod had some pastors that allowed for this position, while the Missouri Synod declared it to be false doctrine.  This Election Controversy had been introduced by a German professor in the Norwegian Synod, Friedrich A. Schmidt.  The Norwegian Synod left the Synodical Conference in 1883, attempting to keep the disunity they experienced within their Synod from creeping into the Synodical Conference.  Meanwhile, the Wisconsin and Missouri Synods stood together in cooperation and harmony during this period of fierce debate.&lt;ref&gt;Roy A Suelflow.''Walking With Wise Men''. Milwaukee: [[South Wisconsin District (LCMS)]], 1967, p.120.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bennett Law ===
Along with other ethnically German denominations, the Wisconsin Synod successfully spoke out in opposition to the Wisconsin [[Bennett Law]], a compulsory education law that also required certain subjects be taught in English and put public authorities in charge of enforcing compliance in both public and private schools. Wisconsin's German-American Lutherans and Catholics saw the law as an attack on their parochial schools and parental rights. They also believed the law was a nativist attack on their German culture. The law was enacted in 1889 and repealed in 1891.

=== Apache mission ===
[[Image:Mayerhoff.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rev. Paul Mayerhoff lived in this tent for six months in 1896 at the beginning of his Call as a Wisconsin Synod missionary to the Apache. He catechized children, learned their language, and translated parts of [[Luther's Small Catechism]] into [[Southern Athabaskan languages|Apache]].]]
In 1893, two Wisconsin Synod missionaries began work in Arizona at [[Peridot, Arizona|Peridot]] and Old [[San Carlos, Arizona|San Carlos]] in the [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation]] among the [[Apache]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apacheland Mission History|url=http://archive.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?2617&amp;collectionID=733&amp;contentID=101624&amp;shortcutID=32538|publisher=archive.wels.net|accessdate=July 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328025653/http://archive.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?2617&amp;collectionID=733&amp;contentID=101624&amp;shortcutID=32538|archivedate=March 28, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congregations were soon established. Currently there are nine Wisconsin Synod congregations on the reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apacheland: Mission Statistics|url=http://archive.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?2617&amp;collectionID=733&amp;contentID=1085&amp;shortcutID=2948|publisher=archive.wels.net|accessdate=July 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328025701/http://archive.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?2617&amp;collectionID=733&amp;contentID=1085&amp;shortcutID=2948|archivedate=March 28, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1917 merger ===
In 1892, the Wisconsin Synod had federated with the Michigan and Minnesota synods to form the General Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan and Other States.  The Nebraska Synod joined the federation in 1904.  In 1917 the synods voted to turn their federation into a formal union, known as the Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Wisconsin and Other States.  By 1930, the merger and other factors had pushed the Wisconsin Synod to become a primarily English-speaking synod.  The present name was adopted in 1959.

=== Protes'tant controversy ===
From 1926–29, a small group of persons and congregations were expelled or voluntarily left the WELS in an incident known as the "Protes'tant Controversy." They formed the [[Protes'tant Conference]].

=== Breakup of the Synodical Conference ===
Doctrinal differences among the synods of the Synodical Conference, especially concerning the doctrine and practice of church fellowship, surfaced during the 1940s and '50s.  Problems began when the LCMS began exploratory talks with leaders of the [[American Lutheran Church (1930)|American Lutheran Church]] (ALC).  The ALC differed on its doctrine of Predestination and therefore did not share doctrinal fellowship with the Synodical Conference.  Since there had been no recent change on the ALC's doctrinal position, the LCMS was then charged by some within the Synodical Conference of changing its position on church fellowship. After years of continued talks, the ELS severed its fellowship relations with the LCMS in 1955 and withdrew from the Synodical Conference. Two years later the WELS publicly recognized the same doctrinal disagreements with the LCMS, but rather than break fellowship, decided to admonish the LCMS to return to its former practice.

Dissatisfaction over this decision led about 70 pastors and a similar number of congregations to leave the WELS, ELS, and LCMS to form the [[Church of the Lutheran Confession|Church of the Lutheran Confession (CLC)]]. Their chief complaint was that the WELS misapplied the principles of Christian fellowship by not breaking immediately with the Synodical Conference and the LCMS after it had publicly recognized doctrinal disagreements. While the WELS broke fellowship with the LCMS in 1961, the CLC and the WELS remain at odds regarding this issue to this day. Recently, the WELS and ELS have been in formal discussions with the CLC over doctrinal issues. The goal of these discussions is to restore fellowship with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress in doctrinal discussions|url=https://wels.net/progress-in-doctrinal-discussions/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223184730/https://wels.net/progress-in-doctrinal-discussions/|archivedate=December 23, 2016|df=mdy-all|access-date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doctrinal discussions continue between the CLC, the ELS, and WELS|url=https://wels.net/doctrinal-discussions-continue-between-the-clc-the-els-and-wels/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223175647/https://wels.net/doctrinal-discussions-continue-between-the-clc-the-els-and-wels/|archivedate=December 23, 2016|df=mdy-all|access-date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of the September meeting of the COP|url=https://wels.net/summary-of-the-september-meeting-of-the-cop/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223182218/https://wels.net/summary-of-the-september-meeting-of-the-cop/|archivedate=December 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference ===
In 1993 the ELS and WELS, working with a number of other Lutheran synods around the world—some of which had been founded through mission work by both synods—founded a new fellowship organization which is the theological successor of the Synodical Conference:  the [[Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference]] (CELC).

== Organization ==

=== Synodical government ===
The WELS is headed by a president and is supported by two vice presidents elected during its synod convention for terms of four years. The president oversees the administration of the synod. The current synod president is Rev. Mark G. Schroeder.

Beneath the president are numerous administrative divisions addressing various areas of ministry. Among these are ministerial education, world missions, home missions, parish services, and fiscal services.

Synod conventions are held biennially in odd-numbered years and consist of elected male lay members from individual congregations from within the synod, ordained pastors and certified male teachers.  Half of all delegates are to be lay members while the remaining half is divided between pastors and teachers. Synod conventions elect synodical leaders, and discuss and vote on synodical business. The [[WELS Synodical Council]] governs the church when the church is not in convention.

The WELS is divided into 12 geographical districts in the United States and Canada, each headed by a district president elected in district conventions held during even-numbered years.  District presidents serve terms of two years.

=== Education ===

[[File:Wisconsin Lutheran College Milwaukee WI WELS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wisconsin Lutheran College]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]
The WELS school system is the fourth largest private school system in the United States. As of 2012, WELS churches and associations operate 406 early childhood centers, 334 elementary schools, 23 high schools, 2 colleges and 1 seminary across the nation, enrolling over 41,000 students in its institutions of learning.&lt;ref name="WELS Schools"&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://school.apostles-lutheran.net/about|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222033836/http://school.apostles-lutheran.net/about|archivedate=December 22, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WELS maintains four schools of ministerial education: two college preparatory schools [[Michigan Lutheran Seminary]] and [[Luther Preparatory School]]; a pre-seminary and teacher training college, [[Martin Luther College]] in New Ulm, Minnesota; and a seminary for training pastors, [[Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary]], located in Mequon, Wisconsin.

[[Wisconsin Lutheran College]], a liberal arts college in Milwaukee, is affiliated with, though not run by, the WELS.

=== Publishing ===

'''Northwestern Publishing House''' (NPH)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nph.net {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020603200639/http://www.nph.net/ |date=June 3, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the official publishing house for the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Located in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], it produces a wide variety of materials including curriculum, periodicals, books, and worship resources.  the publications are mainly for use of churches, schools, pastors, and members of the WELS. Its retail store, NPH Christian Books and Gifts, was also located in Milwaukee, but closed in September, 2018.

Since June 23, 1891, Northwestern Publishing House has served the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod and its members with a variety of products and programs.  The mission of NPH is to publish and provide biblically sound material that communicates, fosters, and supports the Christian faith and life.

Main WELS periodicals include ''[[Forward in Christ: A Lutheran Voice]]'', the WELS's monthly family magazine, and ''[[Wisconsin Lutheran Quarterly]]'', a quarterly theological magazine.

Most WELS churches use ''[[Christian Worship Hymnal|Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal]]'', with some using the 1941 ''[[The Lutheran Hymnal|Lutheran Hymnal]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectwittenberg.org/etext/hymnals/tlh/ The Lutheran Hymnal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609032247/http://www.projectwittenberg.org/etext/hymnals/tlh/ |date=June 9, 2013 }} on Project Wittenburg&lt;/ref&gt; or no hymnal at all. In 1911, the Wisconsin Synod published ''Church Hymnal for Lutheran Services''.

The WELS experienced significant growth during much of the twentieth century. In 1925, there were 139,226 members in 662 churches.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_986.asp|title = Historic Archive CD and ''Yearbook of American &amp; Canadian Churches''|publisher = The National Council of Churches|accessdate = December 7, 2009|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100411123939/http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_986.asp|archivedate = April 11, 2010|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950 there were over 300,000 members.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"/&gt; Membership peaked in the early 1990s at just over 400,000 and has declined slightly since that time.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"/&gt; In 2006 the denomination reported 395,497 members in 1,276 congregations.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"/&gt; [[Wisconsin]] remains the [[geographic center]] of the denomination, with over 400 churches and over 200,000 members.&lt;ref name="RCMS"&gt;For a county by county map, see [http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/pics/geo200/religion/wels.gif Wisconsin Synod Adherents as a percentage of all Residents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121212845/http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/pics/geo200/religion/wels.gif |date=January 21, 2009 }}, or for a state by state map, see {{cite web|url = http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_896_d.asp|title = 2000 Religious Congregations and Membership Study|publisher = Glenmary Research Center|accessdate = December 7, 2009|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100411115259/http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_896_d.asp|archivedate = April 11, 2010|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than Wisconsin, the states with the highest rates of adherence are [[South Dakota]], [[Minnesota]], [[Michigan]], and [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref name="RCMS"/&gt;

Before the late 1960s, the denomination was almost entirely found in the states of the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Great Plains]], but with the migration of WELS people to Southern and Western states and the influx of former LCMS conservatives to the WELS, membership outside the region grew strongly in the 1970s and 1980s.

== Church fellowship ==
Fellowship between the WELS and other church groups is established only upon investigation and confirmation that both church groups hold complete unity in scriptural doctrine and practice. The WELS is in fellowship with the members of the [[Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference]], all of which meet this requirement.
